## SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16.

THE Walsingham Packet, in thirty-six days' passage from Falmouth, with the first October Mails, arrived on Wednesday, and brought London Papers to the 4th inclusive; the latest of which enables us to acquaint our readers, that the conduct of the African Institution has at length become the subject of Editorial scrutiny on the other side of the Atlantic; and that, as one of their numerous calumnies has been fully exposed in a widely-circulated London paper, it is therefore likely others may hereafter be published, so that ultimately they will be ashamed to promulgate their infamous Reports; or, should they be callous enough to continue them, they will cease to have any influence on the minds of the British Public. It will be recollected, that in the Mercury of the 14th of September last, we had the satisfaction of giving a complete refutation of the Tenth Report of that Institution, through the medium of a correspondence between the Hon Mr. Kerby, of Antigua, and His Excellency Sir James Leith:—these documents have appeared in the paper to which we have alluded, and were introduced with the following appropriate head, and equally just remarks upon the evil tendency of the Reports of that 'dangerous Society.'

---

### "GROSS MISREPRESENTATION AND CALUMNY.

"A pretty correct estimate may be formed of the misrepresentation and unfounded calumnies which issue from the Press of the African Institution, relative to the treatment of the Negroes in our West India Colonies, from the following extracts of correspondence between the Hon'ble Mr. Kerby, of Antigua, and His Excellency Sir James Leith, formerly Governor of the Leeward Islands, now Commander in Chief of the Forces in the West Indies.

"In a Report published in May last, and drawn up by a few individuals, who dignify themselves by the title of the African Institution, the following statement appeared:—

[Here follows the Report as it appeared in our paper.]

"This libel, insidiously circulated with a view to prejudice the public against the whole society of the West Indies, naturally excited the indignation of every individual who had acted as Sir James Leith's Aide de-Camp, and gave rise to the two following letters, which speak for themselves, and will warn our readers against trusting the Reports of this dangerous Society."

[Mr. Kerby's Letter and Sir James Leith's Reply are then inserted.]

### For the Barbados Mercury.

Mr. EDITOR—You will oblige a subscriber to your valuable paper, by making public the following observations, for the benefit of all whom it may concern. The free use of the plough, and the vast number of male calves that are devoted to the knife, have rendered the importation of cattle into this Island, from the Cape de Verds and the Island of Porto Rico, necessary, not only for the slaughter-house, but for the use of the Plough. As many persons have already purchased, and many are yet disposed to purchase, cattle of this description, the following observations may be useful:—they may prevent the Merchant from continuing a most destructive practice, and at the same time put the Planter on his guard. In the month of April last, I purchased a lot of Cape de Verd cattle; they were all young oxen, none of them three years old; they were in good condition, sprightly, and well, to all appearance. I carried them home—had them sheltered at noon and night—gave them a very moderate quantity of water—and particular care was taken of them. In a very short time they began to droop, and mope about as though they had a disease of the brain. It was then observed that they had a disease called the Red-waters. They would neither eat nor drink heartily; and although bleeding, cooling and alterative drenches, with mild purgatives, were administered, two-thirds of them died within a few days after they were taken ill, and those that remain are in such a state, that I do not expect they will ever be valuable as working cattle. I really could not account for this mortality amongst them until a few days ago, when a Gentleman informed me, that in all probability it proceeded from the manner in which the cattle were landed. It appears, they are seized by the horns, hoisted, and of course suspended by them, and in that way they are let down into the boat. It is remarkable, that a bull so landed will not answer to breed from, and this proves very clearly that the muscles and spine must sustain the greatest injury by the weight of the whole body being suspended by the horns. It is to this injurious and destructive mode of landing the cattle, that I attribute the loss of mine; and I would recommend every person who wishes to purchase foreign cattle, first to ascertain whether they have been landed by the horns or in the slings.

I am, Sir, your humble servant,  
**An Owner of Carts and Waggons.**

## MARKETS FOR WEST INDIA PRODUCE.

### LONDON, OCT. 1, 1816.

**Liverpool, Sept. 28.**—There has been a pretty considerable demand this week for Cotton for export, chiefly for Boweds and Pernams; some part of these were for Germany, but the greater part of the shipments have been for Havre. There has also been, during the latter part of the week, a pretty fair inquiry from the trade, but they have been expecting to buy on rather more favourable terms. 70 Demeraras sold at 22d. to 2s. 3d.

**SUGAR.**—We had in a heavy market last week for Muscovades; the prices were, however, little varied, till towards the close of the week, when several holders appeared alarmed at the declining prices, and the accumulation of the stock; several rather considerable parcels were in consequence forced upon the market; rather large contracts of Jamaica browns were offered at 69s.; middling at 70s. 6d. to 72s.; it is, however, to be observed, that only a few holders would submit to any further depression, and in consequence several houses effected little or no business during the week.

**COFFEE.**—The Coffee market was heavy, and declining in the early part of last week; towards the close, the request again revived, and the prices went off a shade higher; very considerable parcels of Dutch coffee were brought forward; ordinary, 62s. to 65s.; good fine ordinary, 66s to 72s.; some ordinary Brazil Coffee was taken at 61s.; fine ordinary Havannah, 75s 6d; several parcels of Guadeloupe Coffee were sold, fine ordinary at 73s.; middling 82s 6d; to 83s; and one lot uncommonly fine at 101s. 6d.

## LONDON.

**Oct. 1.**]—The following articles cannot be too widely or generally circulated. We trust it will check that disposition to emigrate to America, which in nineteen instances out of twenty, is so fatal to the person that indulges it.—"The first duty of a man," said Mr Grattan in one of his speeches, "is to stand by his country; and the second duty of a man is to stand by his country; and the third duty of a man is to stand by his country!"

**EMIGRATION TO AMERICA.**—The following is an extract of a letter from James Buchanan, Esq. (British Consul, we believe), dated New-York, August 23:

"You will be surprised that I expect orders daily to take up vessels to send back thousands of emigrants from here to England, Ireland, and Scotland. The applications at this office, this week, to be sent back, amount to 10 for England, eight to Scotland, and 76 to Ireland. Indeed, so great is the distress here, that thousands must starve if some money is not extended to them by our Government, which they have been induced to abandon. I have granted passports to great numbers to go to Upper Canada: hundreds who have been settled here for years have applied to me for permission to go to Canada; but a proper degree of delicacy is observed by our Government, lest it should be alleged we wished to draw any of the citizens from the States to our Colonies. However, it is a degree of satisfaction, that those parts of the Continent which have remained under His Majesty's Government are preferred to the United States, who boast so much of their Superior privileges. I have no objection that this extract should be published in England: on the contrary, I would deem it important that these intimations were fully known, that such emigrants should, in the first instance, go direct to Canada who are obliged to abandon their native soil."

The Island of Lampedosa, which the Americans demand from the King of Naples, is the spot celebrated in Ariosto, as the scene of a fabulous combat between three Christian and three Pagan Knights, to decide the war between Europe and Africa. He calls it Lippadusa; it is no great distance from Tunis and Biserta, the great seat of Moorish empire. It was objected to the Poet by Frederick Fulgoso who had visited the Island, that it was so rough, mountainous, and uneven, that there was not a level foot of ground to be found, and that it was therefore improbable that six Knights should fight on horseback in such a spot. The Poet humorously excuses himself by saying, that an earthquake had overwhelmed a level plain which was there at the time of the battle.

## THE DIVORCE OF THE PRINCESS OF WALES.

A pamphlet has just appeared under the title of "The Attempt to Divorce the Princess of Wales impartially considered, more particularly with reference to the probability of its success." The following are some of its curious contents:—

"There is now no manner of doubt that an attempt will be made next Session of Parliament to dissolve the marriage between the Prince Regent and the Princess, in order to enable His Royal Highness to marry again, and to afford him the chance of having a male heir to the Crown. The following pages are intended to lay before the public some plain thoughts, chiefly respecting the probable issue of this project. In no point of view is it more deserving of attention; for its success or failure involves the question, Whether the Princess Charlotte, and the child she will soon bear, shall succeed to the Crown or not?—and, which is in truth the same thing, Whether upon the decease of the Prince Regent—an event not very remote by the course of nature—there shall be a Sovereign of complete age, and of a character well known to the Country, or an Infant, in whose name the Duke of York may reign, if a competition does not arise between the Princess Charlotte and the Commander in Chief of the Army for the Regency of the Realm.

"The intention of the following remarks is to quiet the alarms which such a prospect as the success of the project must naturally excite in the minds of all who love peace, and dread civil discord as the extreme of public calamity.

"Some have doubted that the attempt would ever be made. They have urged as reasons against it, the intimate political connection which once subsisted between most of the present Ministry and the Princess of Wales: the known fact of the present Lord Chancellor having been Her Royal Highness's confidential adviser during the investigation of 1806-7, and the remarkable circumstance of Mr. Canning, her warm and zealous partisan in those days, and her adviser at the moment of her departure from England in 1814, having lately become a leading member of the Government. Nevertheless, how contrary soever to probability, the resolution is taken to attempt a divorce, under the auspices, publicly and avowedly, of the Ministry; privately and confidentially of others, whose political importance rests principally upon a zealous devotion to the interests of Carlton House. What are the chances of success?

"In the first place, we must not be led away by the confidence with which they are said to have delivered their opinions in favour of this measure.

"We are to consider the course which the business will probably take. To proceed in Doctors' Commons would be manifestly absurd. The rules of the House of Lords require, indeed, a sentence of Separation there, as a necessary step to be taken before a Divorce-bill can be brought in, but they likewise require a verdict and damages in a Court of Common Law, and surely no one contemplates the Prince Regent bringing an action for criminal conversation. Besides, in a suit for separation the defendant may recriminate; which might give rise to much delay and embarrassment. A Bill in the nature of an extraordinary proceeding, like an attainder, or a Bill of pains and penalties, seems more likely to be the course. Let us consider next how this Bill must be carried through.

"3. It will be necessary that the Princess should appear.—She cannot be divorced unheard, unless a very long time be given her, and that she refuse to defend herself. The question then is, will she appear or not? An innocent person, it may be said, cannot do otherwise than meet a charge in person; and so, undoubtedly, would the Princess of Wales, if she were to be tried by a Court of Justice. But it may reasonably be doubted, whether common prudence would justify her in coming before the majorities of the two Houses of Parliament, in a case, judicial indeed as far as regards names and forms, but political in the highest degree, as far as the substance is concerned. We do not, indeed, think she would run any great risk of having the usual Ministerial majorities against her, as we shall presently shew; but can she be expected to feel secure of this, seeing, as she does, every measure carried which the Government proposes? She formerly threw herself upon the House of Commons, and was protected; but she at the same time had the unanimous voice of the country with her. Since that period, she has been unhappily advised to live, or rather to travel abroad for above two years. She took the step contrary to the most urgent, both oral and written, remonstrances, it is said, of Mr. Whitbread and Mr. Brougham, who till that moment had been her counsellors. On the other hand, she finds Mr. Canning, and those who had been her friends, and who advised her to travel, leagued with her enemies. Where then can she look for steady support? The most innocent person in the world might well be expected to shrink from appearing under circumstances so eminently hazardous, if she were not also the most courageous. We cannot think that she will come over; the consequence is, that a long time must needs elapse before the proceedings can be commenced against her. They may be set on foot pro forma at the beginning of the Session, but six months at least must be allowed for a general Citation to appear, and oppose the Bill; and no one step can be taken to forward it, till the Session after; for it must always be borne in mind, that the affair does not call for any great expedition. The two years absence from the realm puts any idea of a spurious issue wholly out of the question; and it would be going rather far for a reason, to urge the Prince Regent's want of conjugal comforts, when he voluntarily relinquished them the year after he was married, and has proved his capability of living without them since 1796.

"4. The length of time which the proceedings must occupy after they are once fairly begun, next deserves our notice. A measure of so extraordinary a nature, wholly unprecedented, and touching the highest matters of law and state, cannot be hurried through like an inclosure or a turnpike bill. We do not at present deny that this is the right form of proceeding, but we contend that it requires to be most deliberately gone about, and carefully watched, and that in every stage they who urge the propriety of delay will be favourably listened to. It cannot be brought in without much preliminary inquiry. There must be Committees of both Houses to examine evidence; Counsel must be allowed to attend on her Royal Highness's part as soon as she pleases to make her appearance; the Committee must report; and the Report being considered, leave must upon mature consideration be given to bring in the bill. Now all this delay is obviously most material to the question of ultimate success in various ways.

"5. A number of most puzzling questions will assuredly arise in the origin and in the progress of the Bill. To specify one only of those which lie about the origin of the measure. The law of the land has provided a peculiar guarantee for the purity of the Royal bed. To defile it is high treason. Does it not seem that having so provided the law has stopt here? May we not well say that so high a penalty was enacted in lieu of all other safeguards? At any rate, when a Bill, when a new and peculiar law is brought in for the occasion, have we not a right to ask whether the old and general law has been enforced? Do the Government then intend to proceed criminally, and against whom? If the alleged treason was committed beyond the seas, does the statute of Henry VIII. authorise a trial of this species of treason within the realm? Did any of the old laws ever contemplate the case of a Queen or Princess of Wales living separate from her husband, much more living abroad with his permission? Would there be no difficulty in outlawing a Princess in such peculiar circumstances, for an act alleged to have been done abroad, more especially as the statutes giving power to try treasons committed abroad say nothing of outlawry? Besides, all such jurisdiction is only over natural-born subjects. How can the Princess, an alien born, be subject to trial in England for offences done beyond seas? Have not those who permitted her to reside abroad, away from her husband, abandoned all right to inquire into her conduct criminally? But the difficulty does not stop here. The same question may be asked as to the proceeding in Parliament. Have not they who partly drove the Princess abroad by bad treatment—partly enticed her by insidious advice—at any rate most improperly allowed her to go—have they not abandoned all right to divorce her for acts done during her absence? There is no question as to the succession. It is not said to be in any danger; and if it were, those who sent her away are they who put it in jeopardy. But it is in no manner of danger. No one affects to think so. Then why seek to dissolve a marriage, which its bitterest enemies can charge with nothing but the sin of ensuring the Princess Charlotte's succession to the Crown? These questions and many others will be found to spring up at every step that is made in this ill-advised measure.

"The mere lapse of time, however, we are disposed to think among the most formidable enemies of the proposed Bill. Each month that runs out brings the Prince Regent nearer to the close of His Royal Highness's reign. If it should terminate before the Bill passes—nay, before the new marriage takes place—nay, before a child of that marriage is born—nay, if His Royal Highness dies before he has a son—and even if that son dies before he comes to the throne, all the supporters of the Divorce Bill are placed in an awkward predicament—they have done their utmost to deprive the Princess Charlotte of her succession, and have failed—she is Queen in spite of them. It is to be hoped that she will forget and forgive; just as it is supposed that the Duke of York, were he Regent, would favour the Gentlemen who took an active part against him in Mrs. Clark's business. But we are here speaking of probabilities, and we cannot help suspecting that many a Member of Parliament will be apprehensive each vote he gives in favour of the project, that he may be laying up for himself a store of enmity at Court by assisting a measure which is very likely not to succeed. What, indeed, are the feelings that will probably arise in each man's mind, when he is called upon to decide whether or not he shall suspend the measure? He may be expected to reason and to feel as follows:—

(Here the writer enters into the views which he imagines will govern our worthy Legislators in such a "delicate investigation".)

"If a great public duty requires it, no public man should shrink from making himself even irreconcileable enemies of the Sovereign's family. But this is not to be risked for trifling things, and still less where the country's best interests are the other way. The whole question here is of a personal nature. Shall I gratify the Prince Regent or the Princess Charlotte? The interests of the state clearly point to the latter. How am I likely to be affected personally? The measure is not sure to succeed. It is beset with difficulties, and a single false step on the part of its author, even not unpractised in the art of slipping, is fatal to it. One such blunder as was daily repeated on the former occasion secures the Princess of Wales's triumph. But suppose it to succeed. The Prince may die before he marries again. He may marry, and have no son. He may have a son, and the son may die. In all these cases the Princess Charlotte is Queen, and I have done my best to prevent it. She Queen in spite of my votes to disinherit her! Are such proceedings likely to be forgotten? She is said to stand perfectly neuter in this affair: the friends of the measure say, that she wishes well to it, and will never shew the slightest feeling even of regret, far less of anger, at its success. But is human nature all at once changed since these new friends entered Carlton-House? Has a Crown no longer any charms? Has a mother no longer any claims upon her daughter's affections? Is domestic feeling become cold all of a sudden, and power indifferent—indifferent to one accustomed all her life to expect its full enjoyment, but never yet gratified with a moment's possession of it—indifferent to a person in the prime of life, in the age of ambition and glory—indifferent to a female? No, no! these things are not to be believed. Whoever supports this ill-advised proceeding makes the Princess Charlotte and her family his irreconcileable enemies; and justly so; for all grounds of a public nature wholly fail; the best interests of the country are against it; and it rests entirely upon personal considerations, namely, a preference of the unborn issue of the marriage which the Prince is desirous of contracting, to the existing Heiress of the Crown and her children.

"The result of these views, both public and private, is sufficiently obvious; they will lead to a rejection of the Bill by the Member whom we are supposing to weigh its merits; and his resolution will be exceedingly strengthened by the reflection that other Members are likely to be influenced by the like considerations; that the Ministers themselves are not very unanimous in its favour; that the sense of the country is clearly against it; and that the probabilities of its failure in some one stage are numerous. No man loves to entangle himself unnecessarily in a contest of this description; thankless if successful; hazardous in the extreme, if it fails; and, upon the whole, much more likely to fail than to succeed.

"For these reasons, we venture to assure the people of England that this measure is pretty certain of meeting the fate which it deserves. Much anxiety may be excited in quarters where feelings of this nature are greatly to be deprecated; much agitation may be created in the community; the business of Parliament may once more be interrupted for a whole Session with the private concerns of our Princes; a publicity deeply to be regretted by all good men may be given to passages in the lives of the Royal Family, not the best calculated to adorn the annals of the House of Brunswick: all those letters, those delicate and painful letters, may be extorted from the parties concerned, which sound advice and uncommon temper, as well as firmness upon former occasions, steadily suppressed:—anecdotes sufficient to palliate, if not to justify whatever can be alleged on the one side, may now be forced into public view by the imperative duty of self-defence on the other part; the taste of the age, the feelings of the people, the decent observances of society, the chaste sentiments of well-regulated minds, all that constitute public decorum, may be outraged by daily discussions, which no attempts of timid or of time-serving men can keep within the walls of Parliament; every frailty of all the Illustrious Persons, who should be the patterns of propriety as of virtue, may be laid bare to the prurient gaze of vulgar curiosity, by the unsparing hand of judicial inquiry—vast mischief—ills hardly to be repaired, may be done to the morals of the nation, as well as to the character and comfort of exalted Individuals. But there is every reason to expect that the design of dissolving the existing marriage of the Prince Regent will fail; that the expectations of the Princess Charlotte will not be defeated; and that the country will be spared the countless evils of a long minority and a contested Regency—evils scarcely differing from those of a disputed succession.

## FRANCE.

In alluding to the recent dissolution of the French Chamber of Deputies (the Representatives of the People of that Country), a London Editor remarks—

"We are scarcely able yet to pronounce a decisive opinion upon this Dissolution of the Chamber. The reflections that present themselves to our minds are various. Our opinion of the party to which the epithet of Ultra-Royalist was attached, need not be repeated. If we allow them the praise of being sincere, it must be admitted that they acted frequently with a degree of intemperance that tended to inflame those passions, and to keep alive those resentments which it should have been their wish and their effort to remove or to soften. They appeared to be animated with the policy which has influenced all former Chambers and Assemblies, since the commencement of the Revolution—the policy of doing every thing at once. Undoubtedly, the grievances to be remedied were great and grievous; but in proportion as the disease was deep and formidable, the application of a cure should have been cautious and circumspect. The best of their proceedings was the anxiety they exhibited to give higher consideration, credit, and dignity to the Clergy. The want of this is one of the most serious evils under which France labours at the present moment. There can neither be expected to be piety nor morality among the people where the Ministers of religion are not independent. Whether the Members of the late Chambers were popular in their several Departments, or whether their conduct was generally approved of, we have no means of knowing with accuracy. In some of the Paris Papers accounts were published of the honours paid them upon their return home after the prorogation of the Chamber. We do not recollect to have seen any of a contrary description. But we own we have been as much surprised as any of our cotemporaries at the Dissolution of the Chamber so immediately before the expected meeting, and many may almost be tempted to add, that they should have preferred the meeting of the late Chamber, "with all its imperfections on its head." For, they would have come from their several departments with a more intimate knowledge of the wants and wishes of the people. They had had time during the recess to have seen what part of their measures were popular, and whether their operation was beneficial or otherwise. They had had an opportunity to ascertain what were of a contrary description; and their experience might have given to their new measures, more moderation, more wisdom, more judgment; whereas a new Chamber may, they may fear, be expected to assemble with the conviction and the policy, that all that their predecessors had done, was utterly unwise and unnecessary. The King says in his preamble that "Since our return to our States, each day has demonstrated to us that truth which we proclaimed on a solemn occasion that the advantage of ameliorating is closely accompanied by the danger of innovating: we are convinced that the wants and the wishes of our subjects unite in preserving untouched that Constitutional Charter which is the basis of public law in France, and the guarantee of general tranquillity."

"The fact is, that innovations have been made almost daily since the King's return. Is it meant to condemn the legal proceedings that have taken place, or the measures by which the regicides were expelled the kingdom? For the purpose of any fair representation of the people of France, 420 Deputies can hardly be deemed too many; too many indeed they might be for management and subservience. Two hundred and sixty will, as our Correspondent says, be liable to much ministerial influence. We apprehend he says truly. But in that case, what sort of a representation can be then said to exist? If it be meant to be urged that the French are not yet fit for legislative discussions and assemblies, or for any great degree of freedom, we are by no means prepared to deny that assertion. The new Chamber will certainly have less liberty of action than the old. The first article of the Ordinance shortens their labours. They must not think of revising the articles of the Constitutional Charter.

"We deliver our opinion upon this new step with considerable hesitation and doubt. We have not yet the means and information before us necessary to speak positively. Some letters from Paris call it a vigorous step: we shall be glad if it does not deserve to be called a vacillating one—a step taken for a present purpose, and to avert a temporary inconvenience. One of our cotemporaries considers it as the work of Russia: and so some of our letters represent it to be, conjointly with this country. But we are very much inclined to doubt this. Why should Russia have a more decisive influence upon the councils of the Thuilleries than Austria, or any other of the great Powers? The Prime Minister, Richelieu, is said to be her nomination or recommendation. Admit that to be the fact, can we suppose the Duke to be in the interest of Russia more than in that of France? If we were to guess the principal cause of the Dissolution of the late Chamber, we should say that Chamber was known to be decidedly hostile to the sale of the Church lands—that the deficit in the finances can only be remedied by that sale, and that hence a new Chamber, reduced in number, and elected more under influence, is to be called, which may offer no Opposition to such a measure. But we repeat, that we speak with doubt and without that information which is necessary to enable us to form an accurate and positive judgment upon the measure. The rise in the French Funds announces that it is a popular one among the moneyed men—they hail it as rendering the national property as an immediate security."
