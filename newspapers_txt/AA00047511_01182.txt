TUESDAY, JANUARY 16.

OUR readers are already acquainted with the interruption that took place in the proceedings of the Military Council, in the case of Marshal Ney, after the examination of several witnesses had been attended to, and the usual process in Courts of that description had been observed, in consequence of an objection being made by Ney, or his Counsel, as to the competency of that Tribunal to try the Marshal, upon the plea that, as a Peer of France, he ought to be arraigned before that Chamber, to answer to any charges that might be exhibited against him. After some arguments, it was at length decided, that the Council of War should be dismissed; and, in conformity with an Ordinance of Louis XVIII. directions were given by the French Minister for the assembling of the Peers, before whom the trial of Marshal Ney commenced on the 21st Nov. last, of which day's proceedings we have inserted the particulars in a subsequent part of this paper; but it is not likely that his fate would be decided for some time after that, owing to an indulgence of several days that had been granted him, for the purpose of bringing forward witnesses in his favour, as well as for the preparation of his defence against those accusations which had been preferred by the King's Commissioners. If we may be allowed to judge of the result of this investigation, from the nature of the charges, it will certainly be that of confirming his guilt, and consigning him to the hands of the executioner, as an expiatory sacrifice for his abominable treachery to his King and Country, in whose cause he had the command of a division of the French Army, but which he basely headed in support of the Standard of Rebellion, and contributed, by every means in his power, to the re-establishment of the Usurper on the Throne of France; whose reign, however, was but of short duration, owing to the powerful interposition of Great Britain, in which she was assisted by the conjoint efforts of those European Powers with whom she is happily allied.

FRENCH CHAMBER OF PEERS, Nov. 21.

TRIAL OF MARSHAL NEY.

At half-past ten, and before the Peers had met, Messieurs Berrier and Dupin, the Marshal's defenders, took their seat at a table placed in the angle formed by the bureau, and one of the extremities of the seats of the Peers. There was distributed among the strangers who were there assembled, a printed paper signed "Dupin and Berrier," and entitled, "Question prejudicielle dans l'affaire du Marechal Ney."

Some minutes after, the Chancellor entered, followed by the Peers. The sitting was then opened.

The Chancellor, as President of the Chamber, spoke as follows:—

"Monsieur the Marshal Ney, accused of high treason against the King, and against the State, is about to make his appearance. I have to remind the public, that witnesses now, for the first time, of a trial so solemn, it is its duty not to show any mark of approbation or disapprobation. I order the Military Commandant to arrest instantly any person who shall deviate from that respect which is due to the Assembly, or from that attention which misfortune claims. Let the witnesses be called in: the accused will afterwards be introduced."

The witnesses then came in, and with them the Commissaries of the King, among whom were their Excellencies the Keeper of the Seals, the Minister of Marine, and M. Bellart, Attorney-General at the Royal Court of Paris. They took their places under the seats of the bureau of the President.

At eleven o'clock precisely the accused entered, and took his seat between his Counsel;—he was dressed in a blue frock coat, with two General's epaulettes, the badge of the Legion of Honour, and the little ribbon of the Order of St. Louis, or of the Legion of Honour.

The Secretary, Keeper of the Archives, performing the functions of Register, then called over the names of the Peers; after which the Chancellor then asked the accused his name, titles, &c.

Answer—Michael Ney, born at Sarre-louis in 1769, Marshal, Peer of France, Duke of Elchingen, Prince of the Moskwa, Chevalier of St. Louis, Great Eagle of the Legion of Honour, Commander of the Order of Christ.

The Chancellor then said—"I warn the Counsel for the accused, that they ought not to allow themselves to say any thing contrary to their conscience, contrary to decency, or contrary to truth. Secretary, read the two Ordinances of the King, and the act of accusation."

The Secretary then read the two Ordinances, and the Act of Accusation:—

Act of Accusation against Marshal Ney, Duke of Elchingen, Prince of Moskwa, Ex-Peer of France.

The Commissaries of the King, charged by the Ordinances of the King of the 11th and 13th instant, to support before the Chamber of Peers the accusation of High Treason, and attempt against the safety of the State, instituted against Marshal Ney, and its discussion, declare, that by the documents and the instructions communicated to them in consequence of the Ordinance of the 13th instant, by Baron Seguier, Peer of France, Councillor of State, First President of the Royal Court of Paris, Commissioner delegated, the Chancellor President of the Chamber, to draw up the said instruction, the following facts result:—

On learning of the landing at Cannes the 1st of March last, effected by Bonaparte, at the head of a band of robbers of several nations, it appears that Marshal Soult, then Minister at War, sent by one of his Aides-de-Camp to Marshal Ney, who was on his estate of Coudreaux, near Chateaudun, an order to repair to his Government of Besancon, where he would find instructions.

Marshal Ney came to Paris on the 6th or 7th (which day is not correctly known), instead of repairing to the place of which he was Governor, as he was ordered to do. The reason he has given is, that he had not got his uniforms: this is plausible. But what is less so is, that according to his own account, he was ignorant, even when he arrived at Paris, either of the fact of the landing of Bonaparte at Cannes, or of the real cause of the order which was sent to him to repair to Besancon. It is very improbable that the Aid-de-Camp of the Minister at War, who carried the order for his immediate departure, made such a great secret of this news, which had become the object of general attention and conversation; one cannot even suspect any motive for his keeping such a matter secret, any more than one can believe that the Marshal would not have been induced, from curiosity, to ask him what were the causes of this sudden order, as the Aid-de-Camp must naturally, if asked, have informed him of the fact. The Marshal, however, wishes it to be believed, that he did not hear of this important news till his arrival at Paris, and then only by chance, at his notary's. This ignorance is not natural, and rather tends to increase than to dissipate the suspicions that the Marshal was concerned in the manoeuvres which led to this invasion, which has been attended with such fatal results.

Our suspicions that the Marshal has taken part in these measures, are considerably strengthened by the depositions of a great number of witnesses, who have reported various circumstances, tending to prove that the Marshal was informed of this landing. By the evidence of the Sieur Beaucaire, the Count de la Genetiere, and the Count de Faverney, we learn that the Marshal asserted, that the return of Bonaparte had been prepared for three months before, and that those who had made contracts with the King's government ought to have known, that they were treating with or for the legitimate Sovereign, Bonaparte! The Count de Faverney in particular, asserts, that General Lecombe assured him the Marshal had said to him, that he had taken all possible steps to render the defection of his troops necessary and inevitable, which he would afterwards settle and determine by the reading of the Proclamation.

Several other witnesses have deposed, that they were told that the Marshal publicly declared in an Inn at Montereau, that the return of Bonaparte had been long preconcerted. Many other witnesses could depose to the same effect; namely, the Baron Capelle, the Marquis of Vauchier, the Sieur de Beaugarde, and the Sieur Garnier, the Mayor of Dole; but as they have been heard before the Council of War, it is not necessary to recall them. In fact, they are no longer on the spot, but their testimonies are already on record.

Justice, however, also demands, that we should state, that several other witnesses, who observed the conduct of the Marshal till the time of the reading of the Proclamation, seem to believe, that till that period he was strictly loyal, and they depose to facts which indicate, that unless the Marshal acted with the deepest dissimulation, he was even then inclined to be faithful to the King.

However this may be, whether this demonstration of fealty was real or feigned, the Marshal, before leaving Paris, had the honour of an interview with the King, who spoke to him with the most affecting kindness, and reposed in him the greatest confidence. The Marshal appeared affected by the good opinion of his Sovereign respecting his loyalty and fidelity, and in a transport of passion, either real or simulated, he protested, that he would bring Bonaparte to Paris in an iron cage, and sealed his declarations of devotedness, by kissing His Majesty's hand. The Marshal at first wished to deny both this expression of enthusiasm, and the liberty which the King had permitted him to take. But he ultimately acknowledged the facts.

It was on the 8th or 9th of March that the Marshal left Paris. He found at Besancon the instructions of the Minister at War, which were in substance, that he was to collect all the disposable forces, in order, efficaciously, to second the operations of Monsieur; and to manoeuvre so as to disturb or destroy the enemy.

Although the different statements of the witnesses have been duly considered, there are certain points on which there can be no doubts. All must agree as to the line of conduct which the Marshal adopted at Lons le Saulnier, on the 14th March.

The Marshal had sent to that town all the troops which were dispersed throughout his district. Some officers, military and civil, who were correct observers of events, and who were justly uneasy at existing circumstances, and the insinuations of certain persons who held different ranks in the army, pointed out to him, as a means of frustrating their bad intentions, the propriety of mixing with them as much as possible, the good and faithful servants of the King, who might be chosen from the National Guards. The Marshal, however, at once rejected these propositions, even with a sort of disdain, by saying that he wished not to have with him weeping alarmists either male or female; and though he retracted a little from this sentiment afterwards, it was with such slowness and repugnance that the measure unfortunately could not be carried into execution, nor could the evil, which the Marshal seemed to foresee without uneasiness, be prevented.

Some witnesses seem to think that till the evening of the 13th of March, the Marshal was faithful; but it is not easy to believe that a period of four or five days, during which the Marshal had met with no obstacle, nor had not seen an enemy, could have been sufficient to make him abandon his fealty, if he had not been pre-disposed to do so. It is a sorrowful tax upon human loyalty to be obliged to declare that the fact cannot be otherwise.

Only five days after the promises he had made to his Master, who had heaped upon him his confidence and his affection, and whom he had deceived by the unlimited professions of an intention which was not expected from him, Marshal Ney betrayed his past glory, as well as his King, his Country, and Europe, by the most criminal desertion. If we think of the gulph of evils in which this conduct has plunged France, or to which he at least contributed as much as was in his power, we shall see that he likewise destroyed by this conduct his own former glory. We may even add, that he betrayed his own army, which was till that time faithful, and who would have resisted bad advice, if their fidelity had been confirmed by the example of a Chief, whose name and military achievements would have commanded the confidence of the soldiers; instead of which he dragged them after him in the road of perjury.

We have said, that up to a certain time, Marshal Ney had not seen an enemy. In this we deceive ourselves: he had seen many; not indeed in open day, but in his own house, in secret, and by night, who met to form with him a shameful alliance, and to make him give up his King, his country, and even his honour.

An emissary of that artisan of the evils of Europe, more capable of carrying on frauds and intrigues than of gaining victories, arrived at the Marshal's on the night of the 13th March last. He brought him a letter from Bertrand, written in the name of his master, in which the latter denominated the Marshal a brave man amongst the brave, and directed him to come over to him.

If it were true that the Marshal was faithful to his Sovereign till that time, nothing more was necessary to induce him to become a traitor to his oaths. His vanity was flattered: his ambition was awakened; the proffered crime was accepted, and it was as early as the next morning that it was put into execution.

The next day, the 14th of March, 1815, he revealed his new intentions to Generals Bourmont and Lecourbe. They have deposed, that they made efforts to excite horror in his mind at such a resolution, but whatever they could say produced no effect upon him. He forced them to attend on the ground where he had ordered the troops to be drawn up, and where, having formed them into a square, he read to them the following Proclamation:—

[Here is inserted the Proclamation of Ney, dated March 13th, which was published in the course of the interrogatories, read before the Military Council.]

The Commissioners then proceed to observe, that it may be imagined what effect such conduct and orders must have produced upon a body of soldiers, under the command of "a revered Chief." The soldiers who were nearest to their General, seduced by the duty of obedience, repeated the rebellious shout which he had uttered, of Vive l'Empereur! The soldiers who were more distant, faithful to the movement of the heart and French honour, and who were far from supposing what an execrable action Marshal Ney had been guilty of, shouted Vive le Roi! Indeed, so far was the delusion from being removed at this moment, that according to the same evidence, many of the Officers and soldiers retired from the ranks with indignation. It also appears that Marshal Ney afterwards permitted the troops to disperse in the town, and commit all manner of excesses, till they lost their reason, and having no time for reflection, and being afterwards ashamed of their conduct, they would not retract.

A great number of Officers, however, among whom was the Count de la Genetiere, withdrew themselves, and the latter wrote a severe letter to Ney, in which he told him that being no longer able to serve under him with honour, he withdrew himself from his staff, and retired to Besancon. He added, that he had long served under the Marshal's orders, and the only regret he felt was at having continued so to serve for the last twenty-four hours.

After a variety of comments on this and similar instances of French honour, on the part of individuals who were under Marshal Ney at the time in question, the Commissioners observe, that the only effect such instances of loyalty produced upon him was to sink him still deeper in treason. They then trace his conduct from the day when he issued the Proclamation till the 11th of March, touching upon his audacity in writing to the Commandant at Auxonne, to give up the place to Bonaparte; and also to the Dukes of Regio and Albufera, inclosing them the orders he had received from Bertrand; and they add, that in a few days afterwards, in order to punish the honourable inactivity of the Commandant of Auxonne, he inscribed his name in the list of those whom he ordered to be deprived of liberty.

Here (say the Commissioners) it is necessary we should stop. All France, all Europe, has seen, since that time, that Marshal Ney persisted in his rebellion. But all the circumstances which apply to his ulterior conduct, being only the consequence of his first act of treason, scarcely deserve notice, after that great proof of unfaithfulness, one of the sources of misfortunes which a fatal usurpation drew upon France.

We must turn our eyes from the scene, because the spectacle is intolerable. But we cannot suppress the heart-rending reflection, that all the evils by which the country is desolated, are owing to a handful of men, who, because they had distinguished themselves by some great military actions, thought that they had a right to put themselves above the law, to trifle with the most sacred feelings, even with fidelity to their King and country, and to cause with impunity all the revolutions which their unreflecting ambition might dictate. They seem to have persuaded themselves, that because they were brave officers, they had a right, in defiance of the nation and of all Europe, to become disloyal subjects and bad citizens; a deplorable doctrine, which, however, is happily only the exclusive system of a few perverse and ambitious men; a doctrine disowned by real military honour, and by that multitude of brave soldiers, whose eyes being again re-opened, can no longer acknowledge glory in those whom they formerly saw in the field of honour, if they do not still observe them in the paths of fidelity to their King and their Country; and if it does not appear that they prove themselves good citizens as well as great captains, and men of principle as well as warriors full of valour.

In consequence of all these different facts, Michael Ney, Marshal of France, Duke of Elchingen, Prince of the Moskwa, and Ex-Peer of France, is accused before the Chamber of the Peers of France, by the Ministers of the King, and Attorney-General of the Royal Court of Paris, Commissioners of His Majesty.

Done in our Cabinet, at the Palace of the Chamber of Peers, at noon, the 10th of November, 1815.

(Signed) Richelieu, Barbe Marbois, Le Comte du Bouchage, Le Duc de Feltre, Vaublanc, Corvetto, De Cazes, Bellart.

The Chancellor.—You have heard, Marshal, the facts of which you are accused; you are charged with having employed against the King a command confided to you by the King; of having drawn up a seditious proclamation, and read it before your army; of having thus excited its insurrection against legitimate authority, and drawn upon France all the calamities of which it has since been the victim. It is not, however, before the Chamber of Peers that you will have to dread the impression of the melancholy recollections; your judges will rather have to guard themselves against recollections of a contrary description,—those of your warlike exploits: but before entering on the business before us, I have to ask you whether you have to propose any exceptions in arrest of proceedings, upon which the Chamber must previously decide.

The Marshal rose, and after having thrice bowed to the assembly, he read from a paper, in a rather firm tone, the following words:

"My Lord and Peers of France,—The Chamber being pleased to allow me my exceptions in arrest of proceedings, I beg you will permit my defender to develop them."

Mr. Berrier, upon a sign to that effect from the Chancellor, opened his speech, and began by stating the point which he wished to establish. It was to this effect:—that considering that a law is still necessary for completing the organization of the Chamber of Peers into a Court of Justice, all proceedings against Marshal Ney should be stayed, until that organization.

In confirmation of this doctrine, M. Berrier entered into reasonings founded partly on the Charter, partly on the laws relative to the instruction of criminal process, and the establishment of special courts.

The defender remarked two singularities in the ordinances assigning the investigation of this business to the Chamber; the first was, that they were issued only for a particular case; the second, that they were the work of the Ministers of His Majesty, who were at the same time the accusers. Let not posterity have it in their power to say, that this law was passed for a single individual—Think of this also, that the Ministers of the King are at once accusers and legislators. The organisation of the Peerage into a tribunal can only be effected by a law which completes it for all citizens and for all times. It is necessary that your functions as judges should be regularised: that you should know whether you are judges of the intention, whether you can pay attention to circumstances of alleviation; it is necessary you should be able to appreciate, whether, when some are left unpunished, who co-operated in the invasion long before Marshal Ney yielded to the empire of circumstances, he might not have claims on your indulgence.

Tribunals, whose names cannot be pronounced without horror, required a majority of two-thirds to condemn, the same is the case with respect to Juries. Have you adopted the same? You must surely allow, that a question so serious should be resolved by a law. If, however, you reject the exceptions which I have endeavoured to enforce, I shall have to present you with reasons to shew the invalidity of the instruction; I shall have to claim a hearing for witnesses in discharge; and, in fine, I shall have to ask of your indulgence an interval sufficient to enable me to prepare my defence,—a defence so considerable and important.

M. Bellart asked whether the length of the pleading which had already taken place, the others which had been announced, and what had been said relative to the examination of witnesses, did not indicate a settled plan. Let the defenders of Marshal Ney bring forward all their exceptions at once. It is too late now to seek his safety in endeavouring to elude the law; the term of this scandalous process must have at length arrived. Let all the time necessary for preparing the defence of the accused, for producing the witnesses, be asked. God forbid that I should oppose it—I should be the first to ask it for the accused; but then the business must be fairly met. I demand, in the name of the King, that the exceptions be set aside, and that the openness of the discussions be immediately proceeded to.

M. Dupin, for the accused.—It is asserted, that our system is adopted for the purpose of gaining time. Such is not our intention; we wish the termination of this unfortunate business; and such termination would have been reached much sooner, if instead of two Ordinances, the Constitutional forms had been followed. In place of the two Ordinances which we attack, a law might have passed; this would have taken longer time, and the accused would not now have had to ask new delays.

The Lord Chancellor.—The Chamber is about to deliberate; let the accused withdraw.

The Peers withdrew to the Rubens gallery. After about an hour's deliberation, they returned, and Marshal Ney having resumed his place, the President stated that the Chamber had decided on hearing the King's Attorney-General.

M. Bellart, after an eloquent exordium, replied to the objection that the Chamber was not a legally constituted Court. He said, "the Charter gives you all the means of exercising your powers. How then will you exercise them? I may cite to you the example of a people who cannot be reproached with want of liberty: the House of Peers, in England, proceeds, as circumstances require: there is there no originating law, in trials for high treason: and probably it will not be absurd in France to pursue the course followed in England. I sum up in a few words, and I say, the King has the right, by the Charter, to make regulations and ordinances for the execution of laws; the Charter also enacts, that the Chamber of Peers shall sit as judges in certain cases. Circumstances demonstrate the necessity of executing this fundamental law of the State. The King has issued ordinances to that effect; these ordinances regulate the form of your deliberations;—nothing is wanting, then, to enable you to commence. The Commissioners of the King claim, that without being stopped by the exceptions proposed by the Counsel of the accused, the trial commence as soon as the Chamber shall deem it convenient.

M. Dupin, in reply, observed, that if his client depended on that Chamber alone, or on its simple approbation of an ordinance of the King to fix the forms of process to be followed before us, and to establish the formalities of regularity, then the legislative authority would be concentrated in one or two branches of the legislature, contrary to the formal meaning of the Charter.

The Chancellor then ordered the accused to be withdrawn, and the Chamber passed into the hall of its deliberations: after an hour and a quarter's deliberation, Marshal Ney was again brought to the bar, and the Chancellor pronounced the following resolution:—

"The Chamber, while it pays due attention to the claims of the King's Attorney-General, waiving decision on the exceptions proposed in this day's sitting, by the accused, order, that he be bound to present, in cumulo, and within the interval of 24 hours, his other exceptions, and to summon his witnesses, under pain of default; in which case it will proceed to the principal discussions, and with this view adjourn till Thursday the 23d instant, at ten o'clock."

After the reading of the Resolution, M. Berrier rose and said: "My Lord Chancellor, the interval for summoning the witnesses is not sufficient."

The Chancellor.—"You have heard the Resolution of the Chamber. Cause the accused and the public to withdraw." The Chamber then rose; and having again met on the 23d, it was then agreed to adjourn until the 4th December.
