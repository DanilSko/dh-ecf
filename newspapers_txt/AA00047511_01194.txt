MR. GRATTAN.

The following brilliant and classical effusion fell from the lips of Mr. Grattan, jun. on occasion of his returning thanks on the health of his father having been given at a public entertainment at the Mansion-house, Dublin, on the 30th September last:—"My Lord Mayor, and Gentlemen, who have done Mr. Grattan the honour of drinking his health, I have on his part to thank you: I regret his absence, because the manner in which you have received his name deserves a return I am inadequate to give; but though he is absent from you now, you are not wholly absent from him. The interest of your city, and of your country, are always present to his mind; he has served her long. I hope he has served her faithfully. Forty years services are some recommendation. He has fought the battles of Ireland in the Irish Parliament, and he gained them. He fought the battles of Ireland in 1779 and in 1782, and he succeeded; these years form the era of Irish character and Irish victory, and they deserve to be remembered, for their fruits were Freedom of Trade and Independence. In the Irish Parliament, he has not only supported the rights of the people of Ireland, but the rights and liberties of the nations of Europe; he opposed, on a late occasion, that system which he had opposed before—a system which he had wellnigh proved the ruin of those countries; a system founded on the vices of mankind, which could only exist as the suppression of their virtues became predominant: a system which tended to demoralize and denationalize all Europe. It set the French wild after their own inventions; and was not satisfied with their servitude, but proceeded to enslave Europe! Great praise is due to these able men who opposed such a system; they fought the battle of Waterloo by anticipation. But what praise is too great—what reward even sufficient, for those gallant soldiers, those illustrious heroes, who gained in the field what others had resolved in debate? What bosom can remain unmoved, or what tongue can remain silent, when we hear the names of a Paget, a Ponsonby, a Pack, and a Wellington? These names will live; their honours are immortal; the laurels they have gained will never fade; they are bathed in their blood, yet they will be refreshed by the grateful tear of their sympathizing countrymen, and will flourish to the latest posterity. Those able senators, and those gallant soldiers, have served their country, and have rescued Europe. We have not only conquered the enemy in arms, we have conquered him in understanding! He admits the superiority of our political institutions, as he does that of our military powers. He commenced by warring against our constitution, and he concludes by adopting it; in our moderation he looks for protection, and he sees the French lilies revive under the guardian shield of the British lion; and thus we afford a signal example to all men, that if perseverance is requisite to gain a cause, moderation is also requisite to secure it. Never did these countries stand so high, never were we in a situation so pre-eminent. We are at the head of Europe, and not only the first nation in Europe, but the first nation in the world! This is the victory of civil liberty over military tyranny.—Our Constitution is adored in France, it is adored in Holland; Magna Charta is triumphant! St. George has no longer a winged demon to encounter. I hope that the glory of these Countries may long continue, and, as far as regards our future prosperity, let me also hope that the balance between England and Ireland may be so held, that nothing shall be taken from one scale to be thrown into the other, but that both may be preserved even—equal honour, equal right, and equal protection. To these Countries I may apply that which was fabled in times of old; whenever the mariners beheld the twin stars shining in the heavens to light them in their nightly course, no shipwreck was to be feared—every thing was secure, every thing was serene; but if only one star was discernible, if Castor appeared without his brother, storms came on, and death, and danger, and destruction, were at hand! Such are the fates of these Countries! Separated, we fall—united, we stand, to be a blessing to the present age, and a benefit to the future."

For the Barbados Mercury.

MR. EDITOR—Although my time, from the kindness of the major part of the late Clients of Phillips & Elder in continuing me their Solicitor, is better employed than in writing in newspapers, yet I shall be obliged to devote a small portion of it, to reply to the illiberal, ungentlemanlike, and false statement of Mr. J. R. Phillips, already commenced in your paper of Tuesday last, in answer to my pamphlet, and which I shall lose no time in doing: as soon as he has concluded. But in the mean time, I must request that you will publish my pamphlet in your paper, that the whole circumstances might be known in all parts of the world to which your paper may go.

When I determined, in consequence of the shameful conduct of Mr. Phillips towards me, to state all the circumstances fairly and candidly, that our friends might be enabled to judge how I had been treated by him, I preferred having them printed in the form of a pamphlet, instead of their being published in a newspaper, because I did not conceive the subject interesting to any persons but his and my particular friends; but as Mr. Phillips has thought proper to adopt a newspaper for the insertion of his answer, I think it a justice due to myself to have my statement also published.

The reply to his answer I shall prepare with the greatest alacrity; and however desirous I have been to keep certain circumstances in my knowledge from the world, I cannot, after the publication of Mr. Phillips's answer, conceal one single fact.

I cannot refrain taking the earliest opportunity to contradict his assertion, that I wished the partnership not to be dissolved, and that I entreated him not to do it. I admit, that at the time when I was about to leave the Island to regain my own and Mrs. Elder's health, I was anxious that no dispute should take place between Mr. Phillips and myself which would prevent me for a time from going; but he knows, that in a very few days after my arrival, not hearing from him on the subject, I wrote to him, saying I considered the partnership between us at an end from that day. It has been the most fortunate circumstance which ever happened to me, as I have retained by far the greater part of the business.—I am, &c.

Feb. 21, 1816.                    J. W. E. ELDER.

FACTS.

On the 7th day of March, 1803, Mr. Phillips and myself entered into partnership,—he to receive two third parts, and I one third part, of the profits arising from our profession as Solicitors. At this period I had many advantageous offers made me by several other Attornies, to enter into partnership with them, but which I declined, in consequence of having served the greater part of my clerkship to Mr. Phillips.

Shortly after our partnership Mr. Phillips went to England, where he remained until March, 1804, when he returned to Barbados, which being again about to leave in March, 1808, our first articles of Copartnership were cancelled, and others executed, by which I was to receive one half of the profits. These, as well as the first articles, were very unequal. The partnership was to be for life, unless Mr. Phillips chose to dissolve it, which he had power to do, and which has been most cruelly used. He had also a power to live in England, if he chose, and where he has almost always been since the partnership.

Mr. Phillips and his family did not return to the Island until the 25th Dec. 1810; again quitted it in April, 1813, and did not return until late in Dec. 1814, when I was just recovering from a most dangerous illness—I mention the periods of Mr. Phillips's departure from and return to the Island, to shew how long he remained in England during our partnership. I had the whole weight of business on my shoulders, even when he was in the Island, and was even obliged (to my sincere regret) to keep our books. In this place, it is but common justice to myself to state, that when I entered into partnership with Mr. Phillips, his business had considerably decreased, in consequence of his being almost constantly in England, and also from his late partner's inattention to the concern. It was not worth more than £1000. per annum, if that,—and when I quitted, it was increased very considerably.

When Mr. Phillips arrived in Dec. 1814, I found it necessary to change my Climate, which I communicated to Mr. Phillips on his coming to see me the day after his arrival. He seemed very much shocked to behold how very, very ill I looked, and said (as I have since understood) that he did not think it possible for me to live. He most cordially agreed that it was absolutely necessary I should go to England, with a view to restore my health, saying, that he was then in good working trim, and was ready to perform every thing in his power to ease me. However, knowing that his own private affairs would require much of his attention, I proposed to engage the professional services of any young man he might select, but at the same time recommended Mr. John Mayers, who had previously applied to me for that purpose. After many objections on Mr. Phillips's part, I prevailed on him to employ Mr. Mayers, and we agreed to allow him, at my suggestion, the remuneration of one-sixth part of the profits of our business during my absence. This measure was never necessary when Mr. Phillips went to England. The fleet in which I was to sail was appointed to leave Barbados on the 26th day of April.

Some time in the month of January preceding I proposed to Mr. Phillips to settle our cash account, as I had always been the cash-keeper, and no settlement had ever taken place during our partnership. I here most solemnly declare, that in asking for a settlement I had no selfish object in view. I wished to ascertain correctly how my account stood, and if I was in debt to endeavour, as speedily as possible, to pay it. On the other hand, it never was my intention, had the balance been most clearly ascertained against Mr. Phillips, to have pressed him for payment, but merely to have carried the balance to his debt in a new account, and to have waited until my return for payment, when I would, by collections, at distant periods, have paid myself, without troubling Mr. Phillips on the subject.

To my proposal of a settlement Mr. Phillips readily agreed, saying, it would be better for both that the account should be corrected during our joint lives, as each may explain errors or concede points of minor consideration, which could not be so well done between a surviving partner and the executor of the deceased. Mr. Phillips at first proposed that one of the lads in the office should copy the account with the credits, and that we could ourselves examine them. To this I made no objection. A few days after, he proposed that Mr. Carrington, his private book-poster, should make up the accounts. To this I acceded, reserving to myself the right of submitting the accounts so to be made up to the inspection of some person on my part, competent to settle partnership accounts. Mr. Carrington accordingly commenced making up the accounts, and about a month after gave me what he termed a sketch, by which he brought me in debt to Mr. Phillips about £1300. To this account I made an objection immediately, saying, that I did not believe I was indebted any thing. In consequence of this I went through the books with Mr. Carrington, gave him every information in my power, and withheld nothing from him that I thought would facilitate his labours. At the same time I pointed out to Mr. Carrington many errors which he never thought proper to take into his consideration.

After having devoted many days to Mr. Carrington, and after he had pored over the books for many weeks, some time about the 11th of April, on Mr. Phillips's inquiring, in my presence, whether the account was made up, Mr. Carrington answered in the affirmative, and stated the balance due from me to Mr. Phillips to be about £3200. This, it must be supposed, alarmed me very much, and I said that the account must be filled with errors—for what could have been done with so much money as I must have received, to occasion so large a balance to be due from me? On this Mr. Phillips expressed himself very angrily, and in the presence of Mr. John Mayers, acknowledged that he had seen and read a letter of mine, in my private letter-book to Messrs. Daniels, saying, that as I did not require the interest on the money lodged by me in their hands they must annually make the interest a principal, so that Interest may accumulate. He said, by way of excuse, that he thought the book (which, by accident I had brought to town that morning, and had left on my table), related to our joint affairs, or he would not have read the letter!!! Mr. Phillips well knew, in the first place, that Phillips & Elder never kept a letter-book; and even had they kept one, he must have been aware, the moment he saw the direction on the top, that it was private, as Messrs. Daniels had no money in their hands belonging to the partnership; nor were they our clients, or in the remotest degree connected with us.

The discovery that I had saved a little money and had it in safe hands in England roused him; and after some unpleasant language on both sides, I told him, that as soon as the account was fairly and properly stated and examined, I would pay whatever (if any) balance was due, even if I sold the last shirt off my back. He said that I had not acted kindly towards him in not paying two debts due from Lambert's Plantation to General Poyer and a Mr. Agard, the circumstances respecting which will be hereafter fully stated. With respect to the account—although the time for my departure drew near, Mr. Carrington did not give me the account until about three or four days previous to the day on which I was to have sailed. The account was very voluminous, and would have required even the most competent bookposter some weeks to examine it; but I was expected to pay it directly, even when on a very cursory view, I discovered that Mr. Carrington had never corrected the errors I had pointed out, amounting to about £1500, and that I was also charged with £1650. as actually received, which it is even uncertain will be paid when due, and which is not due and payable until October, 1817. Mr. Carrington, as it was his duty to have done, never made the same observation against this charge which was made in the ledger. However, I said I would immediately lay it before Mr. Lamprey, whom I considered fully competent to settle it, and with whose settlement I declared I should be perfectly satisfied. I requested Mr. Carrington to see Mr. Lamprey, and say I wished to speak to him as soon as possible. This was on Saturday, as the fleet was to sail on the Wednesday following, but in the course of the day it was in circulation that the vessels from Barbados would not go on Wednesday to join the convoy at St. Thomas's, but would proceed direct to England on the Monday following, under the protection of a vessel of war. I instantly expressed to Mr. P. the pleasure I felt that I should not sail for a week, in which time I hoped Mr. Lamprey would be able to arrange the account. Mr. Lamprey waited on me about eight o'clock on Monday morning, when I explained the nature of the business I wished to engage him to perform, and shewed him the account. He declared it would be impossible to settle the concern in so short a time as one week—it would take at least a month.

In the course of the day of Monday, it was again determined that the Venus (the vessel in which I had taken my passage) would most positively sail on the Wednesday following, in consequence of which, Mr. Phillips urged me in the most strenuous manner to settle the balance found due to him by Mr. Carrington.

I told him that I could not possibly acknowledge the justness of it—that I was charged with having received £1650. which it was not even clear was good, and that there were errors to the amount of upwards of £1500. a list of which I gave him; I also stated that I considered the principle on which the account was made up to be grossly erroneous. Notwithstanding this, he continued to press me for payment, saying, that he required the money to pay some urgent creditors. Harassed as I was to pay an unsettled and unjust account on the eve of my departure for England, and thinking that if I let him have some money, I might spend twelve months in England peaceably, and that when I returned the account could then be fairly settled, and if Mr. Phillips had been overpaid he could give me security for the re-payment, never intending to distress him. I consented that he should receive £1000. sterling from Mr. Oxley, the Master in Chancery, which at the then rate of exchange was £1300. which with £221. previously received from Mr. Oxley, made £1521. I also gave him a Bills from the Hon. Mr. Maynard for £221. some shillings, and paid him some cash—I also gave him two sets of Bills for £250. each, making £500. Sterling, which was equal to £650. the particulars of which, and also of what money I received when going from the Island, will be hereafter stated. This I thought sufficient to satisfy any reasonable man, and on the Wednesday morning, about three hours before I expected to sail, when I made these arrangements he seemed perfectly satisfied. The Venus, however, did not sail on Wednesday; she was to have sailed on the Monday following, but in consequence of the arrival of a Packet, giving information that convoys were dispensed with, it was determined that we should leave on the Friday following. Very unexpectedly on the day before I sailed, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Phillips asked me to lend him £1000. saying, that he was as responsible as any other person, and my money would be safe in his hands, in case I should not be in debt to the partnership.

I told him that if he chose it, he might either make use of a debt of £700. due and payable to me in a few months, or that if it was more agreeable, he might sell a House I owned in town worth £1000. and that I would lend him the money. Both these offers he declined, saying, that he could not collect other persons debts, and that with respect to the house, he could not sell his own property or would have done so some time past to raise money. I promised to consider his request and to give him an answer in the morning. In the morning I was so agitated that I could not bring my mind to business, wherefore, I wrote him an affectionate letter, saying, that I would consider his request maturely on board, and if I possibly could comply with it, for whatever I could lend him. He however at the time he made his request, said he would take a Bill on Messrs. Daniels at twelve months' sight. Shortly after he received my letter above stated, and not more than an hour before I embarked, I received a most unkind letter from Mr. Phillips, saying, that in consequence of my refusing to lend him the sum required, the partnership must be dissolved from that period. At this moment what was I to do—my stores, baggage, and every article was on board, my wife and child ready to take leave of our family. She too looking miserably ill, and likely, without a change of climate, to fall a victim at the early age of twenty-five. My feelings were wrought to the greatest pitch of misery; I sent for a friend and authorized him, as also Mr. Mayers, to say to Mr. Phillips that if he would let matters lie over peaceably till my return, he might draw on me for £500. at twelve months sight. In consequence of this message (which I presume was correctly delivered) Mr. Phillips came to me at Mrs. Finley's, said to me he was perfectly satisfied, and that I might rely on it he would not draw on me unless he was compelled. I do not recollect that I myself mentioned the precise sum to him, but I certainly told him that the Bills must be drawn in the same manner as the two I had already given him, £250. each, payable in twelve months. To this he bowed. This I thought was a great sacrifice; but judge of my astonishment when I received a letter from him, dated 20th of May, (only twenty-two days after I sailed) informing me that he had drawn a Bill on me for £1000. at sixty days sight in favour of Messrs. Gibbes and Son, and that if I did not accept it the partnership would be dissolved the moment it was returned. I had not been in England fifteen days when I received this letter, and therefore I thought it most adviseable to comply with his request, and I accordingly paid the Bill. I thought I should now be permitted to live in peace, but my expectations were vain; he wrote to me a few days after, requesting me to pay Messrs. Daniels £106. which he owed them, and saying that he had written to them to inform them that I would pay it. This letter I received when I was in Devonshire, and did not see Mr. John Daniel until after I received Mr. Phillips's last letter hereafter stated, and of course I refused to oblige him further.

I naturally supposed, as I intended to remain in Devonshire six weeks, that before the expiration of that time, I should have received at least £100. remittance from the collections and profits of the office, and intended to have applied such remittance in payment of Mr. Daniel's account, but I never received one shilling from Mr. Phillips during my residence there; he also wrote to me whilst I was in Devonshire, to say, that many persons, to whom he had applied for payment of their accounts since my departure, had either produced receipts, or stated that they had accounts against me. I left very few unsettled partnership or private accounts; and every one I settled just previous to my quitting I gave a list of to Mr. R. B. Farley, to be delivered to Mr. Carrington, and upon recollection I do not think that I omitted any account. I settled but four, namely, Mr. Henry Megrath's (deceased), which, being very troublesome to enter, I had not time to attend to it, but tied up all the papers together and put them in my drawer, as well as another account when I should have returned and settled with him. I had settled with Mr. John Blake Brown, both of which I informed Mr. Carrington of and requested him to enter. Mr. Thomas Yard's was paid the very day before I sailed, and as one of the young gentlemen in the Office brought me the bill of exchange, I requested him to credit it and charge it to me. Mr. E. Haynes' Warrant of Attorney is inserted in the latter part of the account made out against me, but as it was paid in bills, the fate of which I did not know until my arrival in England, I did not conceive myself chargeable therewith; but I have since added it in a list sent Mr. Phillips, which I sent him in consequence of his last letter, and on the very day I received it, not having the smallest idea that the list left with Mr. Farley had not been entered agreeably to my request.

Notwithstanding all that I did before leaving the Island, I wrote directly on my arrival in England to request him, if he could make use of my Barbados debt of £700. instead of drawing for £500. it would oblige me; but no answer!! Do you suppose that I would ever have done this if I owed the partnership so large a sum of money as Mr. Carrington made out, or that I would not have objected to the account, hereafter stated, had I been able to perceive that he wished to receive Mr. Phillips's money, and to sell my town house and take that also. It is absurd, as the account, hereafter stated will shew, to suppose any such thing.

Now with respect to the two debts due General Poyer and Mr. Agard, which he says I should have paid, and my reasons for not doing so:—I frequently, when Mr. Phillips has been absent from the Island, I have paid off demands against him, which his bookposter told me were correct, and when I have written to him on the subject, he has always blamed me for paying debts that he did not owe;—I was therefore cautious in paying any demands against him when he left the Island in 1813. I wrote to him to know, how I should apply his crop, and the money he might be entitled to from the collections in our office: whether I should pay any pressing, and what demands? His answer was, that I must remit him every shilling I could. Under these circumstances I was applied to by Gen. Poyer's attorneys for payment of his demand. I stated to them that Mr. Phillips would shortly return and settle with them. They desired to have sugar.—I answered, that I could not comply with their request, as Mr. Phillips had desired me to ship all his sugars to Messrs. G. Gibbs & Son, and that I really had it not then otherwise in my power to pay their demands. They threatened an application to the Court of Chancery. In consequence of which I endeavoured to borrow money (not being able at that time to draw), but could not. Having failed, and Mr. Poyer's Attorneys still threatening an application to Chancery, I was induced to look at Mr. Brenan's (the former Master in Chancery) report of the application of the purchase-money of Lambert's Plantation; by which I found that it was not likely that either Gen. Poyer, Mr. Robert Collymore (another creditor), or Mr. Agard, would be paid from Lambert's. With respect to the two first, it was clear; as to the latter, doubtful. I therefore refused to pay Gen. Poyer's demand, and stated my reason that the report must be taken de Novo. He would not listen to what I said, but filed his petition. I was then applied to by Mrs. Bovell, in behalf of Mr. Agard, to whom I stated my doubt as to the probability of his demand being payable from Lambert's;—informed him that the report would be properly rectified on Gen. Poyer's application, and that if he would have the goodness to wait until January, it would be ascertained; by which time, too, Mr. Phillips would be in the Island; but that the debt should be paid, whether Mr. Phillips arrived or not, the moment that Master Oxley made his report. Mr. Bovell said he would not wait, unless I would give my own security, payable in January.—This I refused to do, when it was not certain that the debt would be payable by Mr. Phillips. But at the same time I reserved a sufficient sum in Master Oxley's hands to pay it, as well as Gen. Poyer's, when correctly ascertained, and of this I informed Mr. Philips the moment I saw him, with which he was perfectly satisfied; nor did he ever utter a sentence to the contrary until he had discovered that I had a little money in England, and after this erroneous account had been made out; but on the contrary, said it was fortunate I had not paid Mr. Agard, as instead of £650. besides interest, which was claimed, Mr. Carrington, his bookposter, had discovered that there was not more then £100. due to him, and that it was clear, that General Poyer's demand was not payable from Lambert's. The only dissatisfaction he expressed was, that I should have told General Poyer's Attorneys of his directions to send all the sugar to Messrs. Gibbes, but I was obliged, when pressed, to deliver the sugar in, payment of the demand, to state the fact as it really was.

Under these circumstances, and for no other reason, has Mr. Phillips compelled me to quit England before the object of my voyage was accomplished, and has torn me from a tender and beloved wife and my darling child. I have been obliged to leave Mrs. Elder to regain her health, which was, previous to this circumstance, bad, but now rendered more delicate from her anxiety at our separation.

To shew my anxiety that the account should be fairly settled, no sooner had I arrived in England than I applied to a Mr. Chapman, of Bristol, an eminent accomptant, who informed me that it would not be possible to settle the account correctly unless the objections were first made and agreed to; but by letter declared it as his opinion, that the account was most erroneously made out, and by no means calculated to ascertain our rights.—See the letters Nos. 1 and 2.
