follow that the King was right in boasting one of the mob? A Fishmonger and a Royal Duke are titles incompatible in the same person; and however politeness might have compelled his Royal Highness to accept of the former, he never should have boasted of it as an honour to him, because every man knows that it is not true, and feels such a boast can only make him ridiculous. The laugh which the ridiculousness produces should not be mistaken for applause; it is the reverse. The son of a King should never lose his sense of dignity, especially in an age when so many (among his Royal Highness's present associates, too) wish to pull all dignity down. We have heard with pleasure an anecdote of the Regent a few years ago. The Prince of the Dandies was very intimate with him, so familiar, he made a bet he would call him plainly "Wales," and make His Royal Highness ring the bell. He accordingly watched for an easy moment, and said, "Wales! ring the bell!" His Royal Highness obeyed, and when the servant appeared he told him, "Mr. B. wants his carriage." Mr. B. was thus turned out for his presumption. He won his bet, but the Prince never again spoke to him.

This is the sort of feeling we would have the Duke of Sussex keep up, and not imitate the late Duke of Orleans, who levelled himself down to Philip Egalite, and who, having so grossly lowered himself, being then one of the mob, the Sovereign mob cut off his head, a reward for his baseness of which even he himself admitted the justice. The son of that unfortunate man sat at the Duke's elbow on Saturday, and no doubt warned him of the dangerous consequences of his conduct. The Duke of Sussex should never forget that he is the son of a King: and what is more, he should never forget, it is because he is the son of a King, and not because he is a Fishmonger, that he is treated with so much respect in public. He should never attempt becoming amiable by degrading himself. The more exalted he is, the more Englishmen will feel themselves honoured by his presence. This happily is still the temper of the people of this country, notwithstanding the poison of the French Revolution. In all his Royal Highness says of the honour due to commercial men, we most heartily agree. They are the great cause of the wealth, prosperity and power of the nation, and are not perhaps treated with sufficient distinction. But no eminent merchant would glory publicly in being a Fishmonger, unless it were in derision, which was not the case with his Royal Highness. It may be said, the whole was a convivial joke, and this is the best apology; but that would be a bad compliment to the Fishmongers, which his Royal Highness did not intend, and the jest would not be understood by the public. On the contrary, we know it has been received seriously and with disgust. Kings' sons must not turn royalty into jest at great public meetings, and associate themselves with vulgar, filthy occupations. They may be gracious without being degraded, they may be convivial without forgetting their dignity.

But while we agree in all his Royal Highness said in praise of the trading and commercial classes; while, so far from thinking he should feel sore, we think he should be proud of their approbation; there is one part of his speech on which we differ: he says, while his own conscience tells him he does right he shall ever be satisfied. This is another of the instances, in these times, in which conscience is mischievously understood. From pique or passion a man takes a fit to do a certain thing, and he is sure to find some excuses to himself for his conduct, however culpable it is deemed by the world.—He hears he is condemned. "I care not," he replies, "my conscience approves." A man who trusts to conscious rectitude, in contempt of the opinion of the world, is certainly going astray, gratifying his passions with a sycophant conscience to approve an obstinate humour. In other words, he has his own will of himself—a most dangerous indulgence. Conscience too often waits servilely upon passion. A man to act wisely must look around him and consult the world. There is no other rule of rectitude, but the general opinion of good men; and conscious rectitude, as opposed to the consciousness of possessing good men's approbation, can only be a haughty preference of self-will, to the wisdom of mankind.

## THE LATE KING OF WIRTEMBERG.

Frederick William I. who died, as we have already stated, on the 30th Oct. was born Nov. 6, 1754.—His first wife was a Princess of Brunswick-Wolfenbatel, by whom he had three children. His second wife was the Princess Royal of England, to whom he was married on the 18th of May, 1797. He succeeded his brother as Duke of Wirtemberg on the 23d of December, 1797, and soon after made his peace with the French Republic. It is remarkable that both the commencement and the close of his reign have been distinguished by differences between him and his States, who complain of the infringement of their privileges. In consequence of the peace of Luneville, he was, in 1803, raised to the dignity of Elector, and on the Peace of Presburgh, his States, which were then aggrandised, were converted into a Monarchy. He was proclaimed King on the 1st January, 1806, and since that period a Colossal Crown has been placed on the top of his palace at Stutgard.

This new dignity was, however, dearly purchased by the enormous contingencies of men he was compelled to furnish for the ruinous expeditions of Bonaparte. He was also obliged to give his daughter Catherine in marriage to Jerome Bonaparte, and to marry his eldest son to the Princess Charlotte of Bavaria; but they never cohabited together, and the marriage was dissolved as soon as the author of that forced union was precipitated from the throne.

The sister of the King of Wirtemberg was married to Paul I. and is now empress Dowager of Russia, still enjoying all the consideration which her virtues merit. On the 26th of October, three days before his death, her brother celebrated the birth-day of this Princess at Stutgard.

Frederick William had experienced many reverses of fortune. During the French revolution, when the Republican army advanced on the Danube, he was obliged to fly, and abandon his capital to foreign troops. It was, perhaps, from a wish to avoid such occurrences again, that he afterwards shewed himself one of the most zealous of the Sovereigns of the Rhenish Confederacy, and that he rigorously executed Bonaparte's Conscription Laws in his States. This was one of the principal grievances of which the country had to complain. It must be added, however, that he did not appear insensible to the loss of so many subjects, immolated to gratify the ambition of a foreign despot. After the retreat from Moscow, while Bonaparte was passing the winter gaily at the Thuilleries, the King of Wirtemberg put all his subjects, if we may express ourselves, into mourning, by prohibiting all public amusements.

Frederick William was of an impetuous character, sometimes violent. He loved justice, and maintained it rigorously in his States. Only in some particular cases his own will was substituted for the law. He was well informed in Geography and Natural History, and conversed well on the Sciences. His palace was decorated with indigenous productions. He was pleased to see foreigners visit the Royal edifices, and the servants were particularly instructed to shew them all the works of art which had been executed in Wirtemberg. There is one monument which will perpetuate the memory of this Sovereign, namely Frederick's Haven, a little port which he constructed on the Lake of Constance, and which greatly facilitates the commerce of the Wirtemberghers with the other Countries situated on the Lake.

His son, the Prince Royal, who has succeeded to the Throne, was in England in 1814, when the Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia visited this Country. He lately married the Duchess of Oldenburgh, the Emperor Alexander's sister, and consequently his own cousin. He is a Prince of great merit, distinguished for his abhorrence of Bonaparte, even during the time when the latter was nearly the Sovereign of the Continent, and still more for his gallantry in the campaign of 1813-14, when he commanded the Wirtemberg and some other German troops. His defence of Montmirail, for a whole day, during the advance of the Allies, defeated one of Bonaparte's manoeuvres for cutting off the communication between two of their corps. At the battle of Paris he was also conspicuous. Being greatly beloved by the people and the troops, it may be in his power to render Wirtemberg an useful military State, and another barrier against France. He was born in 1781; is of an athletic though not a large figure, and has greatly the air of an ardent, intelligent soldier. His Queen will be long remembered here.

## NAPLES AND AMERICA.

We know the Americans failed so completely in their demands on the Court of Naples, that instead of obtaining several millions sterling, as the value of a great number of ships and cargoes seized by Murat, nothing was given up to them but two or three small vessels, which, as being of little or no value, remained unsold. To restore these was no more than common courtesy, or, one might say, common honesty demanded; since they were known to be the identical property of the Americans, and had never undergone any transfer whatever. The way in which a French journal speaks of this transaction, is as follows:—"The Americans have obtained of the Court of Naples the restitution of the vessels which had been taken from them. They still claim a further indemnity, but their tone is less menacing. The establishment which they desire to have ceded to them in the Mediterranean would be useful to their commerce, and dangerous to no Power. We do not yet know whether or not they will obtain it."

Now, the journalist knows very well that they have not the slightest chance of obtaining it: he knows that the European Powers in general would not permit the introduction of the Americans into the Mediterranean; and he also knows that, instead of obtaining restitution of the vessels that had been taken from them, they will never obtain one farthing for those which Murat sold, and which comprised nineteen-twentieths of those which he seized. One consolation the owners of these American vessels may derive from the present French papers: they may learn that the fruit of these robberies has purchased Miss Murat a husband. The young lady, it is said, is about to be married to a Hungarian Nobleman, and her mamma is to give her a fortune of three millions of ducats, part of the proceeds, in all probability, of the very vessels in question. As Mr. Pinckney has failed at Naples, and is now on his way to St. Petersburgh, he may call on old Madame Murat in his way, and try the effect of his diplomatic on her purse: no doubt there is still a great deal left in it besides Miss's fortune.

## SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16.

THE Walsingham Packet, in thirty-six days' passage from Falmouth, with the first October Mails, arrived on Wednesday, and brought London Papers to the 4th inclusive; the latest of which enables us to acquaint our readers, that the conduct of the African Institution has at length become the subject of Editorial scrutiny on the other side of the Atlantic; and that, as one of their numerous calumnies has been fully exposed in a widely-circulated London paper, it is therefore likely others may hereafter be published, so that ultimately they will be ashamed to promulgate their infamous Reports; or, should they be callous enough to continue them, they will cease to have any influence on the minds of the British Public. It will be recollected, that in the Mercury of the 14th of September last, we had the satisfaction of giving a complete refutation of the Tenth Report of that Institution, through the medium of a correspondence between the Hon Mr. Kerby, of Antigua, and His Excellency Sir James Leith:—these documents have appeared in the paper to which we have alluded, and were introduced with the following appropriate head, and equally just remarks upon the evil tendency of the Reports of that 'dangerous Society.'

### "GROSS MISREPRESENTATION AND CALUMNY.

"A pretty correct estimate may be formed of the misrepresentation and unfounded calumnies which issue from the Press of the African Institution, relative to the treatment of the Negroes in our West India Colonies, from the following extracts of correspondence between the Hon'ble Mr. Kerby, of Antigua, and His Excellency Sir James Leith, formerly Governor of the Leeward Islands, now Commander in Chief of the Forces in the West Indies.

"In a Report published in May last, and drawn up by a few individuals, who dignify themselves by the title of the African Institution, the following statement appeared:—

[Here follows the Report as it appeared in our paper.]

"This libel, insidiously circulated with a view to prejudice the public against the whole society of the West Indies, naturally excited the indignation of every individual who had acted as Sir James Leith's Aide de-Camp, and gave rise to the two following letters, which speak for themselves, and will warn our readers against trusting the Reports of this dangerous Society."

[Mr. Kerby's Letter and Sir James Leith's Reply are then inserted.]

### For the Barbados Mercury.

Mr. EDITOR—You will oblige a subscriber to your valuable paper, by making public the following observations, for the benefit of all whom it may concern. The free use of the plough, and the vast number of male calves that are devoted to the knife, have rendered the importation of cattle into this Island, from the Cape de Verds and the Island of Porto Rico, necessary, not only for the slaughter-house, but for the use of the Plough. As many persons have already purchased, and many are yet disposed to purchase, cattle of this description, the following observations may be useful:—they may prevent the Merchant from continuing a most destructive practice, and at the same time put the Planter on his guard. In the month of April last, I purchased a lot of Cape de Verd cattle; they were all young oxen, none of them three years old; they were in good condition, sprightly, and well, to all appearance. I carried them home—had them sheltered at noon and night—gave them a very moderate quantity of water—and particular care was taken of them. In a very short time they began to droop, and mope about as though they had a disease of the brain. It was then observed that they had a disease called the Red-waters. They would neither eat nor drink heartily; and although bleeding, cooling and alterative drenches, with mild purgatives, were administered, two-thirds of them died within a few days after they were taken ill, and those that remain are in such a state, that I do not expect they will ever be valuable as working cattle. I really could not account for this mortality amongst them until a few days ago, when a Gentleman informed me, that in all probability it proceeded from the manner in which the cattle were landed. It appears, they are seized by the horns, hoisted, and of course suspended by them, and in that way they are let down into the boat. It is remarkable, that a bull so landed will not answer to breed from, and this proves very clearly that the muscles and spine must sustain the greatest injury by the weight of the whole body being suspended by the horns. It is to this injurious and destructive mode of landing the cattle, that I attribute the loss of mine; and I would recommend every person who wishes to purchase foreign cattle, first to ascertain whether they have been landed by the horns or in the slings.

I am, Sir, your humble servant,  
**An Owner of Carts and Waggons.**

## MARKETS FOR WEST INDIA PRODUCE.

### LONDON, OCT. 1, 1816.

**Liverpool, Sept. 28.**—There has been a pretty considerable demand this week for Cotton for export, chiefly for Boweds and Pernams; some part of these were for Germany, but the greater part of the shipments have been for Havre. There has also been, during the latter part of the week, a pretty fair inquiry from the trade, but they have been expecting to buy on rather more favourable terms. 70 Demeraras sold at 22d. to 2s. 3d.

**SUGAR.**—We had in a heavy market last week for Muscovades; the prices were, however, little varied, till towards the close of the week, when several holders appeared alarmed at the declining prices, and the accumulation of the stock; several rather considerable parcels were in consequence forced upon the market; rather large contracts of Jamaica browns were offered at 69s.; middling at 70s. 6d. to 72s.; it is, however, to be observed, that only a few holders would submit to any further depression, and in consequence several houses effected little or no business during the week.

**COFFEE.**—The Coffee market was heavy, and declining in the early part of last week; towards the close, the request again revived, and the prices went off a shade higher; very considerable parcels of Dutch coffee were brought forward; ordinary, 62s. to 65s.; good fine ordinary, 66s to 72s.; some ordinary Brazil Coffee was taken at 61s.; fine ordinary Havannah, 75s 6d; several parcels of Guadeloupe Coffee were sold, fine ordinary at 73s.; middling 82s 6d; to 83s; and one lot uncommonly fine at 101s. 6d.

## LONDON.

**Oct. 1.**]—The following articles cannot be too widely or generally circulated. We trust it will check that disposition to emigrate to America, which in nineteen instances out of twenty, is so fatal to the person that indulges it.—"The first duty of a man," said Mr Grattan in one of his speeches, "is to stand by his country; and the second duty of a man is to stand by his country; and the third duty of a man is to stand by his country!"

**EMIGRATION TO AMERICA.**—The following is an extract of a letter from James Buchanan, Esq. (British Consul, we believe), dated New-York, August 23:

"You will be surprised that I expect orders daily to take up vessels to send back thousands of emigrants from here to England, Ireland, and Scotland. The applications at this office, this week, to be sent back, amount to 10 for England, eight to Scotland, and 76 to Ireland. Indeed, so great is the distress here, that thousands must starve if some money is not extended to them by our Government, which they have been induced to abandon. I have granted passports to great numbers to go to Upper Canada: hundreds who have been settled here for years have applied to me for permission to go to Canada; but a proper degree of delicacy is observed by our Government, lest it should be alleged we wished to draw any of the citizens from the States to our Colonies. However, it is a degree of satisfaction, that those parts of the Continent which have remained under His Majesty's Government are preferred to the United States, who boast so much of their Superior privileges. I have no objection that this extract should be published in England: on the contrary, I would deem it important that these intimations were fully known, that such emigrants should, in the first instance, go direct to Canada who are obliged to abandon their native soil."

The Island of Lampedosa, which the Americans demand from the King of Naples, is the spot celebrated in Ariosto, as the scene of a fabulous combat between three Christian and three Pagan Knights, to decide the war between Europe and Africa. He calls it Lippadusa; it is no great distance from Tunis and Biserta, the great seat of Moorish empire. It was objected to the Poet by Frederick Fulgoso who had visited the Island, that it was so rough, mountainous, and uneven, that there was not a level foot of ground to be found, and that it was therefore improbable that six Knights should fight on horseback in such a spot. The Poet humorously excuses himself by saying, that an earthquake had overwhelmed a level plain which was there at the time of the battle.

## THE DIVORCE OF THE PRINCESS OF WALES.

A pamphlet has just appeared under the title of "The Attempt to Divorce the Princess of Wales impartially considered, more particularly with reference to the probability of its success." The following are some of its curious contents:—

"There is now no manner of doubt that an attempt will be made next Session of Parliament to dissolve the marriage between the Prince Regent and the Princess, in order to enable His Royal Highness to marry again, and to afford him the chance of having a male heir to the Crown. The following pages are intended to lay before the public some plain thoughts, chiefly respecting the probable issue of this project. In no point of view is it more deserving of attention; for its success or failure involves the question, Whether the Princess Charlotte, and the child she will soon bear, shall succeed to the Crown or not?—and, which is in truth the same thing, Whether upon the decease of the Prince Regent—an event not very remote by the course of nature—there shall be a Sovereign of complete age, and of a character well known to the Country, or an Infant, in whose name the Duke of York may reign, if a competition does not arise between the Princess Charlotte and the Commander in Chief of the Army for the Regency of the Realm.

"The intention of the following remarks is to quiet the alarms which such a prospect as the success of the project must naturally excite in the minds of all who love peace, and dread civil discord as the extreme of public calamity.

"Some have doubted that the attempt would ever be made. They have urged as reasons against it, the intimate political connection which once subsisted between most of the present Ministry and the Princess of Wales: the known fact of the present Lord Chancellor having been Her Royal Highness's confidential adviser during the investigation of 1806-7, and the remarkable circumstance of Mr. Canning, her warm and zealous partisan in those days, and her adviser at the moment of her departure from England in 1814, having lately become a leading member of the Government. Nevertheless, how contrary soever to probability, the resolution is taken to attempt a divorce, under the auspices, publicly and avowedly, of the Ministry; privately and confidentially of others, whose political importance rests principally upon a zealous devotion to the interests of Carlton House. What are the chances of success?

"In the first place, we must not be led away by the confidence with which they are said to have delivered their opinions in favour of this measure.

"We are to consider the course which the business will probably take. To proceed in Doctors' Commons would be manifestly absurd. The rules of the House of Lords require, indeed, a sentence of Separation there, as a necessary step to be taken before a Divorce-bill can be brought in, but they likewise require a verdict and damages in a Court of Common Law, and surely no one contemplates the Prince Regent bringing an action for criminal conversation. Besides, in a suit for separation the defendant may recriminate; which might give rise to much delay and embarrassment. A Bill in the nature of an extraordinary proceeding, like an attainder, or a Bill of pains and penalties, seems more likely to be the course. Let us consider next how this Bill must be carried through.

"3. It will be necessary that the Princess should appear.—She cannot be divorced unheard, unless a very long time be given her, and that she refuse to defend herself. The question then is, will she appear or not? An innocent person, it may be said, cannot do otherwise than meet a charge in person; and so, undoubtedly, would the Princess of Wales, if she were to be tried by a Court of Justice. But it may reasonably be doubted, whether common prudence would justify her in coming before the majorities of the two Houses of Parliament, in a case, judicial indeed as far as regards names and forms, but political in the highest degree, as far as the substance is concerned. We do not, indeed, think she would run any great risk of having the usual Ministerial majorities against her, as we shall presently shew; but can she be expected to feel secure of this, seeing, as she does, every measure carried which the Government proposes? She formerly threw herself upon the House of Commons, and was protected; but she at the same time had the unanimous voice of the country with her. Since that period, she has been unhappily advised to live, or rather to travel abroad for above two years. She took the step contrary to the most urgent, both oral and written, remonstrances, it is said, of Mr. Whitbread and Mr. Brougham, who till that moment had been her counsellors. On the other hand, she finds Mr. Canning, and those who had been her friends, and who advised her to travel, leagued with her enemies. Where then can she look for steady support? The most innocent person in the world might well be expected to shrink from appearing under circumstances so eminently hazardous, if she were not also the most courageous. We cannot think that she will come over; the consequence is, that a long time must needs elapse before the proceedings can be commenced against her. They may be set on foot pro forma at the beginning of the Session, but six months at least must be allowed for a general Citation to appear, and oppose the Bill; and no one step can be taken to forward it, till the Session after; for it must always be borne in mind, that the affair does not call for any great expedition. The two years absence from the realm puts any idea of a spurious issue wholly out of the question; and it would be going rather far for a reason, to urge the Prince Regent's want of conjugal comforts, when he voluntarily relinquished them the year after he was married, and has proved his capability of living without them since 1796.

"4. The length of time which the proceedings must occupy after they are once fairly begun, next deserves our notice. A measure of so extraordinary a nature, wholly unprecedented, and touching the highest matters of law and state, cannot be hurried through like an inclosure or a turnpike bill. We do not at present deny that this is the right form of proceeding, but we contend that it requires to be most deliberately gone about, and carefully watched, and that in every stage they who urge the propriety of delay will be favourably listened to. It cannot be brought in without much preliminary inquiry. There must be Committees of both Houses to examine evidence; Counsel must be allowed to attend on her Royal Highness's part as soon as she pleases to make her appearance; the Committee must report; and the Report being considered, leave must upon mature consideration be given to bring in the bill. Now all this delay is obviously most material to the question of ultimate success in various ways.

"5. A number of most puzzling questions will assuredly arise in the origin and in the progress of the Bill. To specify one only of those which lie about the origin of the measure. The law of the land has provided a peculiar guarantee for the purity of the Royal bed. To defile it is high treason. Does it not seem that having so provided the law has stopt here? May we not well say that so high a penalty was enacted in lieu of all other safeguards? At any rate, when a Bill, when a new and peculiar law is brought in for the occasion, have we not a right to ask whether the old and general law has been enforced? Do the Government then intend to proceed criminally, and against whom? If the alleged treason was committed beyond the seas, does the statute of Henry VIII. authorise a trial of this species of treason within the realm? Did any of the old laws ever contemplate the case of a Queen or Princess of Wales living separate from her husband, much more living abroad with his permission? Would there be no difficulty in outlawing a Princess in such peculiar circumstances, for an act alleged to have been done abroad, more especially as the statutes giving power to try treasons committed abroad say nothing of outlawry? Besides, all such jurisdiction is only over natural-born subjects. How can the Princess, an alien born, be subject to trial in England for offences done beyond seas? Have not those who permitted her to reside abroad, away from her husband, abandoned all right to inquire into her conduct criminally? But the difficulty does not stop here. The same question may be asked as to the proceeding in Parliament. Have not they who partly drove the Princess abroad by bad treatment—partly enticed her by insidious advice—at any rate most improperly allowed her to go—have they not abandoned all right to divorce her for acts done during her absence? There is no question as to the succession. It is not said to be in any danger; and if it were, those who sent her away are they who put it in jeopardy. But it is in no manner of danger. No one affects to think so. Then why seek to dissolve a marriage, which its bitterest enemies can charge with nothing but the sin of ensuring the Princess Charlotte's succession to the Crown? These questions and many others will be found to spring up at every step that is made in this ill-advised measure.

"The mere lapse of time, however, we are disposed to think among the most formidable enemies of the proposed Bill. Each month that runs out brings the Prince Regent nearer to the close of His Royal Highness's reign. If it should terminate before the Bill passes—nay, before the new marriage takes place—nay, before a child of that marriage is born—nay, if His Royal Highness dies before he has a son—and even if that son dies before he comes to the throne, all the supporters of the Divorce Bill are placed in an awkward predicament—they have done their utmost to deprive the Princess Charlotte of her succession, and have failed—she is Queen in spite of them. It is to be hoped that she will forget and forgive; just as it is supposed that the Duke of York, were he Regent, would favour the Gentlemen who took an active part against him in Mrs. Clark's business. But we are here speaking of probabilities, and we cannot help suspecting that many a Member of Parliament will be apprehensive each vote he gives in favour of the project, that he may be laying up for himself a store of enmity at Court by assisting a measure which is very likely not to succeed. What, indeed, are the feelings that will probably arise in each man's mind, when he is called upon to decide whether or not he shall suspend the measure? He may be expected to reason and to feel as follows:—

(Here the writer enters into the views which he imagines will govern our worthy Legislators in such a "delicate investigation".)

"If a great public duty requires it, no public man should shrink from making himself even irreconcileable enemies of the Sovereign's family. But this is not to be risked for trifling things, and still less where the country's best interests are the other way. The whole question here is of a personal nature. Shall I gratify the Prince Regent or the Princess Charlotte? The interests of the state clearly point to the latter. How am I likely to be affected personally? The measure is not sure to succeed. It is beset with difficulties, and a single false step on the part of its author, even not unpractised in the art of slipping, is fatal to it. One such blunder as was daily repeated on the former occasion secures the Princess of Wales's triumph. But suppose it to succeed. The Prince may die before he marries again. He may marry, and have no son. He may have a son, and the son may die. In all these cases the Princess Charlotte is Queen, and I have done my best to prevent it. She Queen in spite of my votes to disinherit her! Are such proceedings likely to be forgotten? She is said to stand perfectly neuter in this affair: the friends of the measure say, that she wishes well to it, and will never shew the slightest feeling even of regret, far less of anger, at its success. But is human nature all at once changed since these new friends entered Carlton-House? Has a Crown no longer any charms? Has a mother no longer any claims upon her daughter's affections? Is domestic feeling become cold all of a sudden, and power indifferent—indifferent to one accustomed all her life to expect its full enjoyment, but never yet gratified with a moment's possession of it—indifferent to a person in the prime of life, in the age of ambition and glory—indifferent to a female? No, no! these things are not to be believed. Whoever supports this ill-advised proceeding makes the Princess Charlotte and her family his irreconcileable enemies; and justly so; for all grounds of a public nature wholly fail; the best interests of the country are against it; and it rests entirely upon personal considerations, namely, a preference of the unborn issue of the marriage which the Prince is desirous of contracting, to the existing Heiress of the Crown and her children.

"The result of these views, both public and private, is sufficiently obvious; they will lead to a rejection of the Bill by the Member whom we are supposing to weigh its merits; and his resolution will be exceedingly strengthened by the reflection that other Members are likely to be influenced by the like considerations; that the Ministers themselves are not very unanimous in its favour; that the sense of the country is clearly against it; and that the probabilities of its failure in some one stage are numerous. No man loves to entangle himself unnecessarily in a contest of this description; thankless if successful; hazardous in the extreme, if it fails; and, upon the whole, much more likely to fail than to succeed.

"For these reasons, we venture to assure the people of England that this measure is pretty certain of meeting the fate which it deserves. Much anxiety may be excited in quarters where feelings of this nature are greatly to be deprecated; much agitation may be created in the community; the business of Parliament may once more be interrupted for a whole Session with the private concerns of our Princes; a publicity deeply to be regretted by all good men may be given to passages in the lives of the Royal Family, not the best calculated to adorn the annals of the House of Brunswick: all those letters, those delicate and painful letters, may be extorted from the parties concerned, which sound advice and uncommon temper, as well as firmness upon former occasions, steadily suppressed:—anecdotes sufficient to palliate, if not to justify whatever can be alleged on the one side, may now be forced into public view by the imperative duty of self-defence on the other part; the taste of the age, the feelings of the people, the decent observances of society, the chaste sentiments of well-regulated minds, all that constitute public decorum, may be outraged by daily discussions, which no attempts of timid or of time-serving men can keep within the walls of Parliament; every frailty of all the Illustrious Persons, who should be the patterns of propriety as of virtue, may be laid bare to the prurient gaze of vulgar curiosity, by the unsparing hand of judicial inquiry—vast mischief—ills hardly to be repaired, may be done to the morals of the nation, as well as to the character and comfort of exalted Individuals. But there is every reason to expect that the design of dissolving the existing marriage of the Prince Regent will fail; that the expectations of the Princess Charlotte will not be defeated; and that the country will be spared the countless evils of a long minority and a contested Regency—evils scarcely differing from those of a disputed succession.

## FRANCE.

In alluding to the recent dissolution of the French Chamber of Deputies (the Representatives of the People of that Country), a London Editor remarks—

"We are scarcely able yet to pronounce a decisive opinion upon this Dissolution of the Chamber. The reflections that present themselves to our minds are various. Our opinion of the party to which the epithet of Ultra-Royalist was attached, need not be repeated. If we allow them the praise of being sincere, it must be admitted that they acted frequently with a degree of intemperance that tended to inflame those passions, and to keep alive those resentments which it should have been their wish and their effort to remove or to soften. They appeared to be animated with the policy which has influenced all former Chambers and Assemblies, since the commencement of the Revolution—the policy of doing every thing at once. Undoubtedly, the grievances to be remedied were great and grievous; but in proportion as the disease was deep and formidable, the application of a cure should have been cautious and circumspect. The best of their proceedings was the anxiety they exhibited to give higher consideration, credit, and dignity to the Clergy. The want of this is one of the most serious evils under which France labours at the present moment. There can neither be expected to be piety nor morality among the people where the Ministers of religion are not independent. Whether the Members of the late Chambers were popular in their several Departments, or whether their conduct was generally approved of, we have no means of knowing with accuracy. In some of the Paris Papers accounts were published of the honours paid them upon their return home after the prorogation of the Chamber. We do not recollect to have seen any of a contrary description. But we own we have been as much surprised as any of our cotemporaries at the Dissolution of the Chamber so immediately before the expected meeting, and many may almost be tempted to add, that they should have preferred the meeting of the late Chamber, "with all its imperfections on its head." For, they would have come from their several departments with a more intimate knowledge of the wants and wishes of the people. They had had time during the recess to have seen what part of their measures were popular, and whether their operation was beneficial or otherwise. They had had an opportunity to ascertain what were of a contrary description; and their experience might have given to their new measures, more moderation, more wisdom, more judgment; whereas a new Chamber may, they may fear, be expected to assemble with the conviction and the policy, that all that their predecessors had done, was utterly unwise and unnecessary. The King says in his preamble that "Since our return to our States, each day has demonstrated to us that truth which we proclaimed on a solemn occasion that the advantage of ameliorating is closely accompanied by the danger of innovating: we are convinced that the wants and the wishes of our subjects unite in preserving untouched that Constitutional Charter which is the basis of public law in France, and the guarantee of general tranquillity."

"The fact is, that innovations have been made almost daily since the King's return. Is it meant to condemn the legal proceedings that have taken place, or the measures by which the regicides were expelled the kingdom? For the purpose of any fair representation of the people of France, 420 Deputies can hardly be deemed too many; too many indeed they might be for management and subservience. Two hundred and sixty will, as our Correspondent says, be liable to much ministerial influence. We apprehend he says truly. But in that case, what sort of a representation can be then said to exist? If it be meant to be urged that the French are not yet fit for legislative discussions and assemblies, or for any great degree of freedom, we are by no means prepared to deny that assertion. The new Chamber will certainly have less liberty of action than the old. The first article of the Ordinance shortens their labours. They must not think of revising the articles of the Constitutional Charter.

"We deliver our opinion upon this new step with considerable hesitation and doubt. We have not yet the means and information before us necessary to speak positively. Some letters from Paris call it a vigorous step: we shall be glad if it does not deserve to be called a vacillating one—a step taken for a present purpose, and to avert a temporary inconvenience. One of our cotemporaries considers it as the work of Russia: and so some of our letters represent it to be, conjointly with this country. But we are very much inclined to doubt this. Why should Russia have a more decisive influence upon the councils of the Thuilleries than Austria, or any other of the great Powers? The Prime Minister, Richelieu, is said to be her nomination or recommendation. Admit that to be the fact, can we suppose the Duke to be in the interest of Russia more than in that of France? If we were to guess the principal cause of the Dissolution of the late Chamber, we should say that Chamber was known to be decidedly hostile to the sale of the Church lands—that the deficit in the finances can only be remedied by that sale, and that hence a new Chamber, reduced in number, and elected more under influence, is to be called, which may offer no Opposition to such a measure. But we repeat, that we speak with doubt and without that information which is necessary to enable us to form an accurate and positive judgment upon the measure. The rise in the French Funds announces that it is a popular one among the moneyed men—they hail it as rendering the national property as an immediate security."

## BRIDGE-TOWN.

*Sit mihi fas audita loqui,—et quae ad Rempublicam pertinent in lucem proferre.*

### TUESDAY, DECEMBER 17.

THE ship Keddington, 25 days from London, arrived yesterday, but did not supply us with any papers of later date than those which were received by the last Packet;—we learn, however, that there was nothing of importance in the Journals that had been recently published.

The Flying-fish (tender) came in yesterday, from Antigua; and the Robert Mail-boat, from Islands to leeward.

The ship Grenada, built at this place by Messrs. E. B. Walcott & Co. and intended for H. Farley, Esq. was launched on Saturday last. She is to proceed to that Island, touched here on Saturday for letters. Both ships were bound from London, and have proceeded for their respective destinations.

His Majesty's ships Antelope, Admiral Harvey; and Brazen, Captain Sterling, sailed on Friday for Grenada, and thence to Trinidad and the Spanish Main.—The Scamander frigate left this anchorage yesterday.

**Entered at the Custom-house**—Ship Keddington, from London; brig St. Thomas, from Alexandria; sloops Swift, and Union.

**Cleared**—Brigantine Spencer, for St. Vincent; and Humber, for Grenada.

His Majesty's ships Antelope, Admiral Harvey; and Brazen, Captain Sterling.

## MARKETS FOR WEST INDIA PRODUCE.

### LONDON, NOV. 5, 1816.

**Cotton.**—The purchasers of Cotton by private contract and public sale continue to be at prices a shade lower; last week only 700 bags were disposed of; 7 Demeraras and Berbice sold for 20½d. to 22½d.; and Tobagos 19½d.

**Liverpool, Nov. 2.**—Cottons have been exceedingly dull during the whole of the last week; the dealers have kept out of the market, in the expectation that as the quantity advertised for public sale was considerable, prices might give way: a reduction has accordingly taken place from ¼d. to 1d. per lb. in Sea-Islands, and ½d. in other descriptions of Cotton.

**Sugar.**—The demand for Muscovades continued limited last week: the low browns were offered a shade under the former currency, but good and strong Sugars were held with much firmness: it ought to be particularly mentioned that the deliveries have been lately very extensive, and the stocks, which were formerly 20,000 hhds more than last year, are now nearly reduced to the same quantity as warehoused 5th Nov. 1815, and only two vessels we believe in the docks to unload; independently therefore of any decrease for distillation, or even the anticipation or fear of such an event, it is very improbable Sugars should decline materially from the present prices, more especially as the stock appears only sufficient for the usual supply of Europe, the late low prices have greatly promoted the consumption. Muscovades rate about 10s per cwt. lower than at the same season last year.

**Coffee.**—The advance of 3s. per cwt. in the price of Coffee, mentioned on Wednesday last, was scarcely supported; only three trivial public sales were brought forward last week, amounting in all to 892 casks and 609 bags; the whole went off at an advance 2 or 3s. per cwt, very choice lots, in several instances, went 3s. 6d. higher. Jamaica is the object of choice; it is in great demand, and is generally supported. Dutch continues to improve, and has recently been very well supported in the public sales. Coffee lately has been selected as a favourite article of speculation; the prices were very low, and the stocks trivial; the supply is about a fourth of what was in the warehouse at the same season last year, and a considerable proportion of the arrivals from the West Indies are short crops, a great proportion of the Estates are turned from Sugar Plantations, and our importations have kept decreasing for several years past, and are now inadequate to the demand for Europe.

## OPENING OF THE FRENCH SESSION.

### THE KING'S SPEECH.

At one o'clock this day (Nov. 4), the King proceeded in state to the Chamber of Deputies, and the Peers and Deputies being present in the costume of their respective Houses, His Majesty delivered from the Throne the following Speech:

**Gentlemen**—In Opening this new Session, it is extremely agreeable to me to have to rejoice with you upon the benefits which Divine Providence designed to bestow upon my people and upon me, the same disposition of the foreign Sovereigns, and the exact observance of Treaties, guaranty to us peace without; and if a senseless enterprise has of late instant caused alarm relative to our interior tranquillity, it has only served to elicit a further proof of the attachment of the Nation, and of the fidelity of the Army.

My personal happiness has been increased by the union of one of my children (for you know, my nephews are mine) with a young Princess, whose amiable qualities seem uniting the attentions of the rest of my family, promise me a happy old age, and will give, I trust, to France, new pledges of prosperity, by confirming the order of succession, the first of the bases of this Monarchy, and without which no State can be in safety.

To these blessings, it is true, there are annexed real pains. The intemperance of seasons has delayed the harvest; my people suffer and none more than they do: but I have the satisfaction of being able to inform you, that the evil is temporary;—remedies, or assistance, where they are necessary, are speedily arriving.

I shall lay before you a faithful statement of the expenditure which is indispensable, and of the means for meeting them. The first of all is economy. I have already made it operative in all parts of the Administration, and I labour without ceasing to make it still more so.—Always united in sentiment and intention, my family, and myself will make the same sacrifices this year as the last, and, for the rest, I rely upon your attachment and your zeal for the good of the State and the honour of the French name.

I continue with more activity than ever my negotiations with the Holy See, and I have the confidence that their happy termination will restore perfect peace to the Church of France. But this is not all, and you will be of opinion with me, no doubt, that we ought not to restore to Divine Worship that splendour which the piety of our fathers had bestowed upon it (that would unfortunately be impossible)—but to ensure to the Ministers of our Holy Religion an independent income, which shall place them in a condition to be able to follow the steps of Him of whom it is said, that he did good wherever he went.

Attached by our conduct, as we are in heart, to the divine precepts of religion, let us be also attached to the Charter which, without touching any dogma, ensures to the faith of our fathers the pre-eminence that is due, and which, in the civil order, guaranties to all a wise liberty, and to each the peaceful enjoyment of his rights, of his condition, and of his property. I will never suffer any attack to be made upon the fundamental law—my Ordonnance of the 5th of September sufficiently shews it.

In fine, Gentlemen, let all hatreds cease: let the children of the same Country, I dread to add, of the same father, be really a people of brothers, and that from our past evils there remain to us only a sad but useful recollection. Such is my object, and to attain it I rely upon your co-operation, but above all upon that frank and cordial confidence, the sole solid basis of an Union so necessary between the three branches of the Legislature. Rely also upon the same dispositions in me, and let my people be well assured of my unshaken firmness in repressing the efforts of malevolence, and in restraining the impulse of too ardent zeal.

## THE LATE PUBLIC MEETINGS IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND.

The Resolutions of the Glasgow Meeting have appeared in the Opposition Gazette, and contain internal evidence of having originated in the same shop as those of Nottingham, Cornwall, &c. They talk of an approaching and alarming crisis. In Cornwall we are on the brink, at Glasgow on the verge of ruin. In Cornwall the National Debt is 1,100,000,000 at Glasgow 1000 millions, and the interest 45 millions, nearly double the actual amount. The people at Nottingham disdain to Petition: they forcibly remonstrate: those of Glasgow demand of the Rulers, not as a favour but as a right. In the Glasgow Resolutions, indeed, the Oligarchy is not mentioned, that being a word not likely to be understood, or easily pronounced, by a mob of Scotch mechanics. Mob, we say, in defiance of the Opposition Journals, and so says Doctor Johnson, who describes "the crowd" as a mob. Now the Meeting at Glasgow boasts of having been very much crowded in the Tobacconist's Field.—"A mob" says the Doctor, is "to harass and vex by tumult,"—Exactly the conduct of these sort of Assemblies. The illustration from Addison is "A cluster of Mob were making themselves merry with their betters;" and Dryden observes—

"Dreams are but interludes, which fancy makes,  
When Monarch reason sleeps, this mimic wakes;  
Compounds a medley of disjointed things,  
A Court and a Mob of Kings."

The Glasgow mob, then, describe themselves as Consisting of the Burgesses and other Inhabitants; and as we yesterday observed, respecting Cornwall, under the last words can be included the discontented of all degrees and denominations, all the refuse of the town—ignorance and poverty as well as pampered sedition. It is the great scheme of the Movers at these Meetings, to collect together the "other Inhabitants," as they can easily be misled to usurp the functions of those classes whose voice alone in this country had spoken with authority in public Meetings previously to the French Revolution.—The Resolutions state the Mechanics in and about Glasgow as amounting to 40,000, and then report gives out all were present, which is untrue, not more than a tenth of that number having shewn themselves, and not half of them joining in or understanding exactly what was going forward. Of these the Report says, thousands are out of work, or earning scarcely so scanty a pittance as mocks existence. The part thus suffering is undoubtedly entitled to pity, to relief, to compassion, and should be spoken of with tenderness, spoken to kindly; but not if they demand redress as a right, disdaining it as a favour. There is a tone of insolence in this language ill agreeing with a scanty pittance that mocks existence. Indeed there is nothing like a petitioning spirit in any part of the proceedings. The tone of the Resolutions is that of defiance, of menace, and the mob should have been punished for assembling under false pretences. The public guardians are accused of looking on with apathy and indifference to the destruction of trade, though it is so obviously the interest of those guardians to encourage it by every possible exertion, were it only (as the mob allow) to increase the revenue. In our late Treaties, it is added, our commercial interests have been overlooked; but what say the Partisans of Bonaparte in Germany and Flanders? That the English enjoy so much commercial indulgence, the foreign manufacturers are ruined. And as for France;—the mob which deprecates internal interference in the affairs of that country, would not surely have had us dictate the free import of muslins to the ruin of "the flourishing establishments" of Rouen and Picardy. It is derided with indignation, as a gross insult, that the sudden transition from War (a peace has occasioned our difficulties, though the same consequences from the same cause are experienced in every other part of Europe; nay, even in that dearly beloved and most adorable Republic, that practical example of freedom of conscience and the rights of man, over which the tried friend of Bonaparte presides, the United States of America; even there the distress of a revulsion from war to peace is more bitterly felt than in any part of the world. And surely the distress in the United States is not produced by the corrupt Ministry of England? But this is a subject far beyond the comprehension of a mob, and therefore it is presumptuous in a mob flippantly to decide upon it. But well they know the fact, and if they had had half as much candour as sedition in them, they would not have put forth the grievance. At the end of the American war, too, the same revulsion took place; and so it always has done, and will do, less or more, at the end and at the beginning of every war. The Glasgow mob should have known this, too, before they set up for Statesmen. That they did not know such notorious facts proves their incapacity; or knowing them, their dishonesty is recorded. Equally dishonest is their pretended alarm for our civil and religious liberties. That the former have been much extended, their own Meeting and unpunished language is a practical proof; that the latter have been still more increased, they may see by the magnificent Gothic chapel for the Roman Catholic worship just springing up, in full view, on the banks of the river, in the heart of the town, mocking by its ornamental elegance the plain Presbyterian temples around it. Thirty years ago the Catholics in Scotland could only assemble for worship by stealth in some large garrets thrown into one, on the tops of houses inhabited by their own sect; and in such horror was the religion held by the whole people, no laws were made against it, the dread of the popular vengeance being sufficient to restrain it from extension. But now, in Glasgow and Edinburgh, the most splendid and public of the places of worship are those of the Roman Catholics; and yet the Glasgow mob pretend to tremble for religious freedom! Surely the President, the Laird of the Field of Thrushgrove, must have thrown his snuff in the eyes of the mob when he proposed such a resolution. They must have sneezed at it desperately, as it is so notoriously false. Equally false is it that the war was waged for the restoration of the Bourbons. Peace has been repeatedly made with Bonaparte; but, as he has lately confessed at St. Helena, he had determined no real peace should ever exist between France and England till this country Was conquered, and Englishmen, even the descendants of Wallace too, made the slaves of Frenchmen. England had no alternative but the overthrow of that Usurper, or utter ruin, extinction as a nation. The Bourbons were invited to the Throne by a portion of those who had been distinguished men among the Republicans of France, but who were at last disgusted at the caprice and tyranny of Bonaparte. England and her Allies have supported the Bourbons on the Throne as the shortest way of re-establishing general tranquillity, and not with any view either to the freedom or oppression of the French people. The Glasgow Mob have discovered that the Public Debt of this country is not "a National Debt," as those who voted it were not elected by universal suffrage; and that those who have not votes for Members of Parliament, are not bound to pay any thing towards it. By the same rule the Laws of the Land and the whole Constitution are an usurpation upon the natural rights of the people, which should be resorted to for the formation of a new system of Government. And would not this be a Revolution? Do not these men, then, aim at a Revolution? But if our present system of Government be an usurpation upon the rights of the people, what of that?—Bonaparte was an Usurper; and general submission was taken as a proof of popular choice. Then why not grant to the English system of Government the benefit of the same reasoning? Especially since its usurpation has existed from times going back beyond the reach of written records.

THE DUKE OF SUSSEX.
At a dinner, given by the Fishmongers' Company, on the 23d Nov. of which an account was given in the Courier of Monday, the Duke of Sussex embraced an opportunity of replying to the observations on his conduct in boasting, on a former occasion, that together with the Prince of Cobourg and Duke of Gloucester, he was a Fishmonger. In the sentiments he expressed on Saturday, on this subject, we entirely concur. The highest man in the empire should be proud of the applause of any respectable class, however low their calling; but it does not follow that he should boast of being one of them. There is much difference between necessarily acquiescing—in accepting a compliment, and unnecessarily bragging of it; between holding up a Fishmonger as a character more prominently for respect than that of a King's Son. The buzzes of the mob gladden the heart the King; but does it follow that the King was right in boasting one of the mob? A Fishmonger and a Royal Duke are titles incompatible in the same person; and however politeness might have compelled his Royal Highness to accept of the former, he never should have boasted of it as an honour to him, because every man knows that it is not true, and feels such a boast can only make him ridiculous. The laugh which the ridiculousness produces should not be mistaken for applause; it is the reverse. The son of a King should never lose his sense of dignity, especially in an age when so many (among his Royal Highness's present associates, too) wish to pull all dignity down. We have heard with pleasure an anecdote of the Regent a few years ago. The Prince of the Dandies was very intimate with him, so familiar, he made a bet he would call him plainly "Wales," and make His Royal Highness ring the bell. He accordingly watched for an easy moment, and said, "Wales! ring the bell!" His Royal Highness obeyed, and when the servant appeared he told him, "Mr. B. wants his carriage." Mr. B. was thus turned out for his presumption. He won his bet, but the Prince never again spoke to him.
This is the sort of feeling we would have the Duke of Sussex keep up, and not imitate the late Duke of Orleans, who levelled himself down to Philip Egalite, and who, having so grossly lowered himself, being then one of the mob, the Sovereign mob cut off his head, a reward for his baseness of which even he himself admitted the justice. The son of that unfortunate man sat at the Duke's elbow on Saturday, and no doubt warned him of the dangerous consequences of his conduct. The Duke of Sussex should never forget that he is the son of a King: and what is more, he should never forget, it is because he is the son of a King, and not because he is a Fishmonger, that he is treated with so much respect in public. He should never attempt becoming amiable by degrading himself. The more exalted he is, the more Englishmen will feel themselves honoured by his presence. This happily is still the temper of the people of this country, notwithstanding the poison of the French Revolution. In all his Royal Highness says of the honour due to commercial men, we most heartily agree. They are the great cause of the wealth, prosperity and power of the nation, and are not perhaps treated with sufficient distinction. But no eminent merchant would glory publicly in being a Fishmonger, unless it were in derision, which was not the case with his Royal Highness. It may be said, the whole was a convivial joke, and this is the best apology; but that would be a bad compliment to the Fishmongers, which his Royal Highness did not intend, and the jest would not be understood by the public. On the contrary, we know it has been received seriously and with disgust. Kings' sons must not turn royalty into jest at great public meetings, and associate themselves with vulgar, filthy occupations. They may be gracious without being degraded, they may be convivial without forgetting their dignity.
But while we agree in all his Royal Highness said in praise of the trading and commercial classes; while, so far from thinking he should feel sore, we think he should be proud of their approbation; there is one part of his speech on which we differ: he says, while his own conscience tells him he does right he shall ever be satisfied. This is another of the instances, in these times, in which conscience is mischievously understood. From pique or passion a man takes a fit to do a certain thing, and he is sure to find some excuses to himself for his conduct, however culpable it is deemed by the world.—He hears he is condemned. "I care not," he replies, "my conscience approves." A man who trusts to conscious rectitude, in contempt of the opinion of the world, is certainly going astray, gratifying his passions with a sycophant conscience to approve an obstinate humour. In other words, he has his own will of himself—a most dangerous indulgence. Conscience too often waits servilely upon passion. A man to act wisely must look around him and consult the world. There is no other rule of rectitude, but the general opinion of good men; and conscious rectitude, as opposed to the consciousness of possessing good men's approbation, can only be a haughty preference of self-will, to the wisdom of mankind.

THE LATE KING OF WIRTEMBERG.
Frederick William I. who died, as we have already stated, on the 30th Oct. was born Nov. 6, 1754.—His first wife was a Princess of Brunswick-Wolfenbatel, by whom he had three children. His second wife was the Princess Royal of England, to whom he was married on the 18th of May, 1797. He succeeded his brother as Duke of Wirtemberg on the 23d of December, 1797, and soon after made his peace with the French Republic. It is remarkable that both the commencement and the close of his reign have been distinguished by differences between him and his States, who complain of the infringement of their privileges. In consequence of the peace of Luneville, he was, in 1803, raised to the dignity of Elector, and on the Peace of Presburgh, his States, which were then aggrandised, were converted into a Monarchy. He was proclaimed King on the 1st January, 1806, and since that period a Colossal Crown has been placed on the top of his palace at Stutgard.
This new dignity was, however, dearly purchased by the enormous contingencies of men he was compelled to furnish for the ruinous expeditions of Bonaparte. He was also obliged to give his daughter Catherine in marriage to Jerome Bonaparte, and to marry his eldest son to the Princess Charlotte of Bavaria; but they never cohabited together, and the marriage was dissolved as soon as the author of that forced union was precipitated from the throne.
The sister of the King of Wirtemberg was married to Paul I. and is now empress Dowager of Russia, still enjoying all the consideration which her virtues merit. On the 26th of October, three days before his death, her brother celebrated the birth-day of this Princess at Stutgard.
Frederick William had experienced many reverses of fortune. During the French revolution, when the Republican army advanced on the Danube, he was obliged to fly, and abandon his capital to foreign troops. It was, perhaps, from a wish to avoid such occurrences again, that he afterwards shewed himself one of the most zealous of the Sovereigns of the Rhenish Confederacy, and that he rigorously executed Bonaparte's Conscription Laws in his States. This was one of the principal grievances of which the country had to complain. It must be added, however, that he did not appear insensible to the loss of so many subjects, immolated to gratify the ambition of a foreign despot. After the retreat from Moscow, while Bonaparte was passing the winter gaily at the Thuilleries, the King of Wirtemberg put all his subjects, if we may express ourselves, into mourning, by prohibiting all public amusements.
Frederick William was of an impetuous character, sometimes violent. He loved justice, and maintained it rigorously in his States. Only in some particular cases his own will was substituted for the law. He was well informed in Geography and Natural History, and conversed well on the Sciences. His palace was decorated with indigenous productions. He was pleased to see foreigners visit the Royal edifices, and the servants were particularly instructed to shew them all the works of art which had been executed in Wirtemberg. There is one monument which will perpetuate the memory of this Sovereign, namely Frederick's Haven, a little port which he constructed on the Lake of Constance, and which greatly facilitates the commerce of the Wirtemberghers with the other Countries situated on the Lake.
His son, the Prince Royal, who has succeeded to the Throne, was in England in 1814, when the Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia visited this Country. He lately married the Duchess of Oldenburgh, the Emperor Alexander's sister, and consequently his own cousin. He is a Prince of great merit, distinguished for his abhorrence of Bonaparte, even during the time when the latter was nearly the Sovereign of the Continent, and still more for his gallantry in the campaign of 1813-14, when he commanded the Wirtemberg and some other German troops. His defence of Montmirail, for a whole day, during the advance of the Allies, defeated one of Bonaparte's manoeuvres for cutting off the communication between two of their corps. At the battle of Paris he was also conspicuous. Being greatly beloved by the people and the troops, it may be in his power to render Wirtemberg an useful military State, and another barrier against France. He was born in 1781; is of an athletic though not a large figure, and has greatly the air of an ardent, intelligent soldier. His Queen will be long remembered here.

NAPLES AND AMERICA.
We know the Americans failed so completely in their demands on the Court of Naples, that instead of obtaining several millions sterling, as the value of a great number of ships and cargoes seized by Murat, nothing was given up to them but two or three small vessels, which, as being of little or no value, remained unsold. To restore these was no more than common courtesy, or, one might say, common honesty demanded; since they were known to be the identical property of the Americans, and had never undergone any transfer whatever. The way in which a French journal speaks of this transaction, is as follows:—"The Americans have obtained of the Court of Naples the restitution of the vessels which had been taken from them. They still claim a further indemnity, but their tone is less menacing. The establishment which they desire to have ceded to them in the Mediterranean would be useful to their commerce, and dangerous to no Power. We do not yet know whether or not they will obtain it."
Now, the journalist knows very well that they have not the slightest chance of obtaining it: he knows that the European Powers in general would not permit the introduction of the Americans into the Mediterranean; and he also knows that, instead of obtaining restitution of the vessels that had been taken from them, they will never obtain one farthing for those which Murat sold, and which comprised nineteen-twentieths of those which he seized. One consolation the owners of these American vessels may derive from the present French papers: they may learn that the fruit of these robberies has purchased Miss Murat a husband. The young lady, it is said, is about to be married to a Hungarian Nobleman, and her mamma is to give her a fortune of three millions of ducats, part of the proceeds, in all probability, of the very vessels in question.

THE Subscriber being about to retire from his Island at the close of the present year, for the purpose of arranging his concerns, previous to leaving the same, (he hopes at no distant time), requests the assistance of those indebted to him to accomplish his intention. His real friends, from whom he has long experienced kindness, he relies much on, convinced he shall have their best assistance; but he is sorry to say, some have trespassed on his indulgence, which now can not be longer granted. He therefore expects all indebted, either on Open Accounts, or Note, long standing, will come forward the ensuing crop, and either pay or settle their accounts to his satisfaction, by the 1st March next, as after that period they will be placed in the hands of his Solicitor, to proceed for their recovery.
He will dispose of his Properties both in Town and Country.
